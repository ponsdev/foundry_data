The information presented here would normally be acquired over the course of a longer adventure, but for the purposes of this one-shot, is provided by L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne hands the players a copy of this research on a piece of paper (see @JournalEntry[YE8CmPDhjQDiiMoR]{L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne's Research Notes}).</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Dr. Stein. </span>Francis Stein was a renowned biomancer until the people of Aramachi chased him out of his tower. The Tanukin used their illusions to trick him into thinking a werewolf was attacking. He was terrified of lycanthropy and used to wear all sorts of silver jewellry. Despite often proclaiming he &ldquo;loved all animals equally&rdquo; and being a vegan, he never ceased on his quest to make &ldquo;the ultimate chimera&rdquo;.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Enchantments. </span>Aratawa is enchanted with anti-fly, anti-climb, and anti-teleport magic. Any spell that grants a fly speed, climb speed, or levitation is instantly dispelled when you enter a one-mile radius of the wizard&rsquo;s tower. Any item that grants these effects has the effects suspended whilst in the tower&rsquo;s anti-magic field. The only way in is through the front door.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Tooling Up.</span> Fortunately, gliding is not inhibited. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne has acquired squirrelsuits; one for each player. Once the players are at the top of the tower, they can simply jump off and fly back to him. He&rsquo;s enlisted the help of a local druid, Terrabella (female CG tanukin) to change the weather to mask their escape. In addition, he gives the party a <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">T.H.I.N.G.</span>, explaining that Houdinky might have left clues which the device can translate.

An octopus with snakes for tentacles has the length of each paralysed limb covered in golden rings. A pointy-nosed humanoid sprouting black and white fur wears supple leather boots.

A faint, burnt sulphurous smell reminds you of old eggs and charcoal. You spot a doorway on the far side, door ajar, the stairs beyond leading upwards. A sign to your right reads &lsquo;Floor 5&rsquo;. That seems odd...</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">Still and plain, this square-ish chamber has the feel of a corridor; often passed through but seldom lived in. Light from windows on either side of the door behind you further illuminates the floor&rsquo;s large flagstones. Atop one such stone sits a pile of ash, a rounded white object protruding from the mound. A bone, perhaps?</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">The flagstones &ndash; each of which measures about 5 feet on a side &ndash; are carved with large arrows. There seems to be neither rhyme nor reason to the layout of the arrows. No reason, that is, until some graffiti between door and window catches your attention. Rows of arrows point up, down, left, or right, and a small familiar-looking symbol is carefully inked to one side.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Light.</span> The room is brightly lit</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Sound</span>.

Glass and metal paraphernalia clutter a desk to your right, limbs and body parts of various creatures hanging from the ceiling above it.

They shift their stony inside in order to send the creatures that wander within them on a never-ending journey. They slowly drain their victims of life force until they are too exhausted to escape, before finally beginning the digestive process.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">Mechanics</span></h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">In order not to give the game away that the characters are being drained, this next section involves rolling <span class=\"CharOverride-3\">in secret</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">. It&rsquo;s recommended that you get a note of each character&rsquo;s Constitution saving throw modifier and hit points when they enter the staircase. To make it even more fluid, you could even pre-roll saves and damage before this encounter takes place. See Appendix C for the </span><span class=\"CharOverride-3\">loopling </span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> statblock.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Draining. </span><span class=\"None\">For each 10 minutes that go by, roll a</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"> DC 10 Constitution saving throw</span><span class=\"None\"> in secret for each player character. The character takes 5 </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">(1d10) necrotic damage</span><span class=\"None\"> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. This damages accumulates gradually and is not a &lsquo;blow&rsquo; that can be felt. If a character fails by 5 or more (</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">DC 5</span><span class=\"None\">), it also gains a level of </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">exhaustion</span><span class=\"None\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Secretly record the damage and levels of exhaustion, but dress up the effects. For example, if a character becomes bloodied, you could say &ldquo;</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-1\">your nose suddenly starts bleeding, and you could swear you have a migraine coming on</span><span class=\"None\">&rdquo;. If a character becomes exhausted you could say &ldquo;</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-1\">You begin to feel woozy, your feet stumbling as you climb this unending staircase</span><span class=\"None\">&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Solutions 1: Pepper. </span><span class=\"None\">The </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">l</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">oopling</span><span class=\"None\"> hates pepper. If the players sprinkle it anywhere on the staircase, it stimulates the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">loopling&rsquo;s</span><span class=\"None\"> vomit feature and the players are jettisoned onto the floor above, prone and covered in slime. A stone wall is all the players see when they look back in the direction from whence they were vomited. This stone wall is the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">loopling</span><span class=\"None\">&rsquo;</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">s</span><span class=\"None\"> skin and can be attacked.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Solution 2: Spreading Out. </span><span class=\"None\">If the players split up whilst linking themselves (e.g. with rope), the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">loopling </span><span class=\"None\">struggles to contain the dispersed party. It will dissolve any rope with its stomach acid, and vomit the players one by one onto the floor above until only one remains. The players then have to attack the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">Loopling&rsquo;s</span><span class=\"None\"> exterior from the floor above.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Solution 3: Hulk Smash. </span><span class=\"None\">If the players begin attacking the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">loopling</span><span class=\"None\"> from the inside. It immediately begins trying to digest them. When bloodied, the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">loopling</span><span class=\"None\"> will try to vomit all the creatures inside of it onto the second floor.

It has four tumblers, each with the numbers 0-9 on them. The solution is the number with which each floor was labelled: <span class=\"CharOverride-3\">5 8 1 2.</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> If this is entered, it pops open.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Alternatives. </span><span class=\"None\">The hatch can be broken. It has an AC of 15 and 20 hit points. Mel&eacute;e attacks whilst perched on the ladder have disadvantage. Attacking the hatch releases the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">economy chimera</span><span class=\"None\"> if it is not already slain.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2 ParaOverride-8\"><span class=\"None\">A </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves&rsquo; tools)</span><span class=\"None\"> check can successfully jimmy open the padlock. A result of </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">16</span><span class=\"None\"> or lower breaks the lockpicking tools. Attempting to pick the lock, success of fail, releases the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">cut-price chimera</span><span class=\"None\"> if it is not already slain.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">Emerging onto the rooftop the wind whips at your clothing. The city folds out below you, a patchwork of slate roofs and gardens. A leaden weight wrenches your stomach down to your ankles as you peak over the parapet; that&rsquo;s a long way down. &ldquo;Ah! You made it then!&rdquo; the now familiar voice of Houdinky sounds from behind you.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Harried Houdinky</span>. Houdinky had almost completed the heist single-handedly but couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to disarm the orb&rsquo;s pedestal. On checking his escape route (the roof) the trapdoor sealed behind him - it can&rsquo;t be opened from this side. He&rsquo;s been stuck at the top of this tower for a few days, and boy is he glad L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne sent help. Can he hitch a ride with the players?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-2\">Aftermath</h2>\n<div>\n<div id=\"_idContainer000\" class=\"Basic-Text-Frame\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Synopsis\">The party reconvenes</li>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Synopsis\">The party watch the fireworks from the safety of Terrabella&rsquo;s tree.\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud _idGenParaOverride-2\">Eventually, after a few near misses with some confused seagulls, you drop beneath the damp cotton-wool of Terrabella&rsquo;s cloud cover. You orient yourself to land at the agreed-upon rendezvous; the edge of the woods.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne is pleased to see the party, but especially please to have Houdinky back in one piece. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne promptly hands over payment, promising they&rsquo;re &ldquo;<span class=\"CharOverride-1\">not chocolate coins... this time...</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">&rdquo;. He refuses to reveal what the </span><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">chromanova</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> does, persuading them to &ldquo;</span><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">trust me, you&rsquo;ll find out soon enough!&rdquo;</span><span class=\"None\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">Houdinky leads the party to Terrabella&rsquo;s grove, whilst L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne scampers off with a mischievous grin on his face, catching up with the group as they ascend Terrabell&rsquo;as tree. All the rakin are positively brimming with excitement. As the sun sets, you may then read the following:</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">As the last muted rainbows of the sunset fade into the inky depths of a starry night sky (it seems Terrabella has ensured you all a good view), the fireworks begin. It is the harvest festival in the city! Brilliant flashes of emerald and sapphire; enchanted displays of roaring, winged, scarlet snakes; and radiant advertisements for the town&rsquo;s various establishments illuminate the dock and city below. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne paddles his feet against the wood, grasping Houdinky&rsquo;s hand. <br /><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">&ldquo;Soon. Soon!&rdquo; </span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">A cheer rises from the city, bouncing across the forest canopy as a final, huge fire work bathes the valley with the light of a small sun.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\"><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">And then your eyes begin to accustom to the darkness, and the soft twinkle of the stars resumes. Without a sound, night is turned to day. Erupting like a supernova well over a mile wide is a rainbow of coruscating, glittering light. You spy a ripple surging across the treetops and suddenly a </span><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">thdoom</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> blows back you hoods, spills unsecured goblets, and wafts away Terrabella&rsquo;s most recent fart. The twinkling shards fall softly to the buildings and farmland below, where they lie, like a reflection of the stars.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\"><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">A few motes, blown by the wind, settle upon your viewing platform. Glitter. So. Much. Glitter. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne has just glitter-bombed the town.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\"><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">If the party visit the town the next day they will find every single surface covered in glitter. No-one has a clue what to do, and L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne and Houdinky grin, ear-to-ear.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\">Future Hooks</h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">This story could continue in many directions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1-Bullets\">L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne knows of another dungeon with treasure to take.</li>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1-Bullets\">If the player characters were spotted and are identified, they are chased out of town and gain the title &lsquo;The Glitter Gang&rsquo;.</li>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1-Bullets\">The mayor hires the adventurers to find the <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">broom of sweeping</span>, an enchanted broom that can clear away any dirt and debris.

They shift their stony inside in order to send the creatures that wander within them on a never-ending journey. They slowly drain their victims of life force until they are too exhausted to escape, before finally beginning the digestive process.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">Mechanics</span></h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">In order not to give the game away that the characters are being drained, this next section involves rolling <span class=\"CharOverride-3\">in secret</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">. It&rsquo;s recommended that you get a note of each character&rsquo;s Constitution saving throw modifier and hit points when they enter the staircase. To make it even more fluid, you could even pre-roll saves and damage before this encounter takes place. See @Actor[68nOtG5kolvZWnRx]{Loopling} for the </span><span class=\"CharOverride-3\">loopling </span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> statblock.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Draining. </span><span class=\"None\">For each 10 minutes that go by, roll a</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"> DC 10 Constitution saving throw</span><span class=\"None\"> in secret for each player character. The character takes 5 </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">(1d10) necrotic damage</span><span class=\"None\"> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. This damages accumulates gradually and is not a &lsquo;blow&rsquo; that can be felt. If a character fails by 5 or more (</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">DC 5</span><span class=\"None\">), it also gains a level of </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">exhaustion</span><span class=\"None\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Secretly record the damage and levels of exhaustion, but dress up the effects. For example, if a character becomes bloodied, you could say &ldquo;</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-1\">your nose suddenly starts bleeding, and you could swear you have a migraine coming on</span><span class=\"None\">&rdquo;. If a character becomes exhausted you could say &ldquo;</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-1\">You begin to feel woozy, your feet stumbling as you climb this unending staircase</span><span class=\"None\">&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Solutions 1: Pepper. </span><span class=\"None\">The <strong>loopling</strong></span><span class=\"None\"> hates pepper. If the players sprinkle it anywhere on the staircase, it stimulates the <strong>loopling</strong></span><strong><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">&rsquo;s</span></strong><span class=\"None\"> vomit feature and the players are jettisoned onto the floor above, prone and covered in slime. A stone wall is all the players see when they look back in the direction from whence they were vomited. This stone wall is the <strong>loopling</strong></span><strong><span class=\"None\">&rsquo;</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">s</span></strong><span class=\"None\"> skin and can be attacked.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Solution 2: Spreading Out. </span><span class=\"None\">If the players split up whilst linking themselves (e.g. with rope), the <strong>loopling</strong></span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"None\">struggles to contain the dispersed party. It will dissolve any rope with its stomach acid, and vomit the players one by one onto the floor above until only one remains. The players then have to attack the l</span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">oopling&rsquo;s</span><span class=\"None\"> exterior from the floor above.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Solution 3: Hulk Smash. </span><span class=\"None\">If the players begin attacking the loopling</span><span class=\"None\">&nbsp;from the inside. It immediately begins trying to digest them. When bloodied, the </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-3\">loopling</span><span class=\"None\"> will try to vomit all the creatures inside of it onto the second floor. If it dies, the players can cut their way out and walk up the actual stone staircase.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}

If your players are especially good puzzlers, consider running the puzzle from &lsquo;Follow the Arrows II&rsquo; here, and using the <span class=\"CharOverride-3\">hard</span> puzzle &ndash; &lsquo;Follows the Arrows III&rsquo; (Appendix D) &ndash; in its place. Whatever you choose, it&rsquo;s recommended to keep the consequences the same as they are.</p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\">Environment</h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">When the party first enters the floor you may read the following:</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">As you set foot on the stone floor, randomly placed stones in the room&rsquo;s wall begin glowing with autumnal shades of red and orange. A faint, burnt sulphurous smell reminds you of old eggs and charcoal. You spot a doorway on the far side, door ajar, the stairs beyond leading upwards. A sign to your right reads &lsquo;Floor 5&rsquo;. That seems odd...</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">Still and plain, this square-ish chamber has the feel of a corridor; often passed through but seldom lived in. Light from windows on either side of the door behind you further illuminates the floor&rsquo;s large flagstones. Atop one such stone sits a pile of ash, a rounded white object protruding from the mound. A bone, perhaps?</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">The flagstones &ndash; each of which measures about 5 feet on a side &ndash; are carved with large arrows. There seems to be neither rhyme nor reason to the layout of the arrows. No reason, that is, until some graffiti between door and window catches your attention. Rows of arrows point up, down, left, or right, and a small familiar-looking symbol is carefully inked to one side.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Light.</span> The room is brightly lit</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Sound</span>.

The doorways to east and west can be passed through from the orthogonally adjacent space.</p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\">Developments</h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">Using the <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">T.H.I.N.G&trade;</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> on the graffiti yields a spoken message by Harried Houdinki. You may show handout C2 to your players and let them access the audio file using the QR code, or read the following yourself.

They have come to the town of Aramachi to steal a rare magical item - the <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">chromanova</span> - from the top of an abandoned wizard&rsquo;s tower, Aratawa. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne desires to detonate the <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">chromanova</span>, the ultimate glitter-bomb, during the upcoming harvest festival. Unfortunately, Houdinky hasn&rsquo;t returned from casing the joint, and L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne is worried.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\">Aramachi Tower is enchanted with anti-fly, anti-climb, and anti-teleport magic; the only way in is through the front door. Within are the various biomantic constructs that Dr. Francis N. Stein left behind after being chased from the tower. L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne provides a means of escape ofr after the party ascend the tower; <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">squirrelsuits</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\"><span class=\"CharOverride-5\">Adventure Hook</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">Looking for a way to drop this into a campaign? Here&rsquo;s some ideas of ways to hook your players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1 ParaOverride-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Curiosity. </span>The players overhear L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne talking about unplundered treasure at the top of an abandoned wizard&rsquo;s tower, and the weird and wonderful magics that might guard it.</li>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1 ParaOverride-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">A Friend in Need. </span>After hearing about the players&rsquo; exploits, a distraught L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne explains that his friend has disappeared. If the party can rescue Houdinky, they&rsquo;re welcome to all the treasure in the tower. In exchange L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne can guarantee a means of escape.</li>\n<li class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1 ParaOverride-3\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Hands for Hire.</span> A bulletin in a local adventurer&rsquo;s guild or town bulletin board promises &lsquo;guaranteed treasure for fleet-footed and quick-witted adventurers&rsquo;, with L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne&rsquo;s address.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"_idContainer000\" class=\"Basic-Text-Frame\">\n<h3 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-3\">Rakin</h3>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">In secret dens beneath city streets, within the hollowed walls of castles, or amongst thick and unkempt underbrush, the rakin reside. A reputation of chicanery, earned or not, follows a rakin through their life. This takes a toll and typically leads them to live out a scorned existence amongst other humanoids, or to isolate themselves with their kith and kin. The masked face of a rakin is seldom accepted in humanoid society.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\">Wherever they scamper, be it through moonlit forests or torchlit streets, rakin have a knack for getting themselves into comically perilous situations. They have a similar aptitude for saving their own hide, unhampered by the destruction they may leave behind. Mischief, whether it be playful, malicious, or unintentional, is the common trait that links all rakin.</p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\">Graffiti and the T.H.I.N.G&trade;</h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">City rakin, known as Urkin, love to leave graffitied notes for each other. A mixture of Thieves&rsquo; Cant and ancient rakin pictograms, these markings can be as informative as they are obscene. Who&rsquo;s easy to rob? Who sleeps with a loaded crossbow under their pillow? Who leaves a plate of warm milk out each night for the stray cats? Deciphering these hieroglyphics can add a new perspective to the ragged tapestry of urban life.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\">L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne has concocted a magical ink for his misplaced accomplice, Harried Houdinky. This ink, which contains elements of the <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">magic mouth</span> spell, records the writer&rsquo;s voice as they paint. Throughout this adventure you will be prompted to give handouts depicting Houdinky&rsquo;s graffiti to your players. These are, in fact, QR codes.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-2\">Using their mobile phones as a proxy for L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne&rsquo;s <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">T.H.I.N.G&trade;</span> (Translator of Highly Indelible and Non-noticeable Graffiti), the players can actually hear the voice of Houdinky. Scanning the QR code will take them to a website from where the audio file can be played. Within foundry, you can play the audio files directly from the Audio Playlists menu.</p>\n<h3 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-3\">Biomancy &amp; Dr. Stein</h3>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">Raising the dead is so stuck in the past. You&rsquo;re limited by what&rsquo;s already existed, only with less flesh and more bones. Practitioners of biomancy, on the other hand, are limited only by their imagination (and the spare parts they can find). Imbue skin with the ability to camouflage, enhance eyesight with the acuity of a hawk, and inspire the very cells of your host with increased mitochondrial activity.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\">Biomancy&rsquo;s forebear, Dr. Francis Norman Stein, was an infamous wizard golemancer. Disruptive, proliferate, and frankly irresponsible, his creations irked the local populace. Eventually, a rare alliance of urkin and tanukin ousted him from his tower, Aratawa, an event known as the &lsquo;Ragged Rakin Revolution&rsquo;.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"}

Windows look out onto a myriad of exotic, silent landscapes: a beach of alabaster-white sand beside a lapping turquoise sea; a forest of silver trunks holding aloft manes of golden leaves; raging blue-black waves that bludgeon austere granite cliffs; a bubbling river of mottled scarlet that you can swear is producing a slightly eggy scent. But all is silent. The only sound is your breathing, the clink of your equipment, and the muffled echo from the dusty room beyond. A sign to your right reads &lsquo;Floor 8&rsquo;. That can&rsquo;t be right.</p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">You take it all in. A door, closed, directly opposite you. A writing desk, incarcerated between crowded bookcases, sits to one side of the door. A bed, raised up on stilts above a copper bath, stands on the other. To your left a small, well-equipped kitchen feels cold, as if it has been years since a fire warmed its hearth. Glass and metal paraphernalia clutter a desk to your right, limbs and body parts of various creatures hanging from the ceiling above it. And, in the centre, a semi-circular chaise lounge embraces scuffed arcane chalk marks which glow with pulsing, chromatic hues.</p>\n<h4 class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Title-4\">How May I Serve You?</h4>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Read-aloud\">As you step forward, the room lights up. The hearth is ablaze, the bath fills with a steaming rose scent, and, with, a <span class=\"CharOverride-1\">clip clop,</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> a half-horse-half-man clad in antique coat-tails approaches you, silver tray in hand. &ldquo;</span><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">How may I serve you, sir?&rdquo;</span><span class=\"CharOverride-2\"> it says, uncovering the tray to reveal three delectable morsels: a vegetable spring roll, a meatball, and a salmon oatcake.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Humperdink-s-Styles_Para-1\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic\">Paying Attention. </span><span class=\"Bold-Italic CharOverride-2\">The tray of food is a test.

As it pulls up in front of you, you realise that it is no creature; it is a </span><span class=\"None CharOverride-1\">hand. </span><span class=\"None\">Balancing on thumb and pinky it proffers up it&rsquo;s three middle fingers.
