  "description": "<p>The infamous thief and gadgeteer, L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne Upin, and his oft-pursued friend, Harried Houdinky, have set their sights on a most guarded treasure; the chromanova. However, with Houdinky misplaced whilst casing the joint, and L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne&rsquo;s last &lsquo;subcontractors&rsquo; missing in action, he now turns to the party.</p>\n<p>Using Houdinky&rsquo;s magically graffitied audio messages, the players must navigate the traps and trials of Dr. Francis N. Stein&rsquo;s abandoned wizard&rsquo;s tower. Will they satiate the servants? Will they surpass the puzzles? And, most importantly, will they emerge from the biomancer&rsquo;s abode unchanged, without having succumbed to one of Dr. Frank Stein&rsquo;s biological experiments?</p>\n<p>This free 5th edition one-shot, optimised for four 5th-level characters, is adapted from L&rsquo;Ars&egrave;ne&rsquo;s Ludicrous Larceny, an adventure designed by Humperdink&rsquo;s Wares and Loot Tavern. The maps herein are generously provided by Tom Cartos, and the foundry conversion spearheaded by Plankdangerous of Gathering Hall Games. This couldn&rsquo;t have been achieved without the Foundry VTT team, in particular Anathema, for whose help we&rsquo;re very grateful.</p>",
