# v0.1.0
# Big update in this release!

Along with the usual tweaks and bug fixes, I've added some configuration options. These options are:
* **Accent Color**: Choose from a list of colors that add a bit of pop to the UI. Before it was a blue color but now the color is more incorporated in the UI and you are able to select from 9 different colors!
* **Corner Radius**: This will let you change how "round" the UI looks overall. Some people prefer a more squared off UI so the option is now there!
* **Blur Level**: This one is one of my originally planned features especially since the blur effect can be performance intensive on lower powered machines so I added an option to select the level of blur. The option will only change the number of elements that get blurred based on what I thought was important or not. For example, the smaller elements like the hotbar and controls will only get the blur effect on the highest setting since they contribute the least amount of visual impact, but if your computer can handle it, the option is there. It defaults to these elements being just transparent with no blur. There is also an option to disable the blur entirely.
* **Theme**: This was a big one and may still have some quirks to work out but now there is a **DARK MODE**. Consider dark mode to be beta right now as there are many places/modules where I'm sure something is impossible to read/too dark. Please post anything you find in the issues section along with the conflicting module(s).
