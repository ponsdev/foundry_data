# A Clean Modern UI
A clean and modern UI for Foundry VTT. Inspired by MacOS/IOS using flat interface and glasslike surfaces. Rounded off all the corners and shifted the interface around a little. 

This is my first delve into modifying Foundry so many of the solutions for this UI may seem hack-y. The blur effects will cause some performance hit, so it may not be suitable for laptop use. Once I get more familair with coding, I'm looking to add a settings menu to change accent colors & maybe a dark mode.

# Customization!
* **Accent Color**: Choose from a list of colors that add a bit of pop to the UI. Before it was a blue color but now the color is more incorporated in the UI and you are able to select from 9 different colors!
* **Corner Radius**: This will let you change how "round" the UI looks overall. Some people prefer a more squared off UI so the option is now there!
* **Blur Level**: Change the amount of blurred elements to better suit your computers performance. These were all captured on a laptop with an nVidia MX150 GPU however Foundry runs at near full performance on LOW with integrated graphics and full performance with blur disabled.
     ### Blur Level FULL:

* **Theme**: This was a big one and may still have some quirks to work out but now there is a DARK MODE. Consider dark mode to be beta right now as there are many places/modules where I'm sure something is impossible to read/too dark. Please post anything you find in the issues section along with the conflicting module(s).
