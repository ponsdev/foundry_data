# 2.4.4 (2022-05-28)
- Overhauled folders in compendiums, a lot of refactoring and tidying up the module.
- Folders now retain sort mode and sort order when importing/exporting. 
- New option added to the create/edit dialog to chose between Alphabetical or Manual sort
- Folders in compendiums now support drag/drop. Behaviour is mostly the same as core Folders.
    - Dragging a folder onto an open folder will move the folder
    - Dragging a folder onto a closed folder will move the folder above the targetted folder (provided they are in the same folder)
    - Dragging a document onto a folder will move the document into the folder (like before)
    - Dragging a document onto another document in the same folder will move the document above the targetted document (provided they are in the same folder)
    - Dragging a document/folder onto the root directory (which extends over the search bar) will move the document/folder to the root directory.
    - Finally, drag/drop highlights are enabled
- Added more functions to the API and added documentation (see README for details)
- You can now import/export Playlist folder structures
- Fixed issue where editing a document in the world would sometimes generate an error in the console.
