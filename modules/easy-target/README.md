A small [Foundry VTT](http://foundryvtt.com/) module that allows for easy targeting whilst holding alt. Also allows for alt+clicking inside an AoE to target all tokens within that AoE. Holding alt while placing a template will also target all tokens within that template when placed.

Clear all targets with alt+shift+c, or ctrl+shift+c on Mac.

It is recommended to also install the [libWrapper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-wrapper/) module for use with easy-target, especially if you encounter compatibility issues with other modules.
