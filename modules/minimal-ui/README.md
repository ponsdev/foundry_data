# JV's Minimal UI for FoundryVTT

Extremely Configurable UI module, allows the user to hide, collapse or auto-hide components separately.

This includes hiding Foundry's Logo, Players List, Scene Navigation and Macro Bar.

## Compatibility issues?

I work on this module based on my personal preferences, and of course share it with others because I love doing so!

Having said that, I only use a small limited subset of modules myself, and making modules work with others out there takes work,
which I am usually honestly not motivated to do. Do consider inviting me a Coffee and let me know which one doesn't work for you, I'll be more inspired afterwards :)

Do track the issue however, it is good that it is not forgotten, or of course feel welcome to submit a pull request that makes it work and I'll happily accept it and give credits.

If you are a Module developer, do consider being Minimal UI Friendly. In terms of colors, this snippet may help you when sharing the colors that Minimal UI settings apply:
```
if (game.modules.get('minimal-ui')?.active) {
  const rootStyle = document.querySelector(':root').style;
  rootStyle.setProperty('--any1-color-property', game.settings.get('minimal-ui', 'shadowColor'));
  rootStyle.setProperty('--any2-color-property', game.settings.get('minimal-ui', 'borderColor'));
}
```

## Patches to Foundry
These are bugs in FoundryVTT that are not currently addressed but are more obvious when using Minimal UI
* When clicking on a sidebar menu that was opened but then closed, clicking on it will open it again instead of doing nothing
* If a window is minimized, when reopened, it would be maximized instead of doing nothing
* If a window is open, but behind other windows, it would be brought to the front when reopened, instead doing of nothing

# Support with Systems and Modules
MinimalUI is made as agnostic as possible. Yet, it is impossible to ensure maximum compatibility.
I invite you to share any systems or modules that conflict with MinimalUI or do not look correctly.
Also do share systems and modules Minimal UI already works with too!
