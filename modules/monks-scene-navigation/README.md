# Monk's Scene Navigation
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
An update to the standard Scene Navigation interface

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
The scenes are now contained to one line at the top.  This makes it easier to plan where to put things on the screen as it won't start expanding across the screen.
The SceneNavigation will now also use the folder structure set up in the Scenes Directory.  So if your adventure has multiple chapters, you can now reduce the number of scenes that are shown while playing.  This is only visible to the GM, players will only see available Scenes on one line.

Added permissions to individual Scenes, so you can now set which players have access to which Scenes on a more granular level.

Icons are added to the Scenes in the Scene Directory to show if the Scene is active or if the Scene has viewing permissions above the default.

And clicking on the Scene will now navigate to it instead of opening the configuration dialog.

## Bug Reporting
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it.  It's very much a work in progress.
