-   A background image or video can now be added to the scenery background (works best with transparency)

-   Added buttons for GM to pause and play narrations
-   Added new settings to control the funcionalities above
-   Changed the CSS style to be more system agnostic
-   Added new `/not(e/ification/ify)` chat command, as an universal way to display GM-only visible notes to chat. This was added primarly to enhance other modules/macros funcionality
