Body paintings have the body painting trait. Applying a body painting takes 10 minutes and two hands: one to hold the jar containing the paint and the other to extract and apply the paint to your body. You can only apply body paint to yourself or to a willing creature within your reach, and you can only have one application of body paint on yourself at a time. Regardless of who applied the paint to your body, only  you can Interact with body paint that's been applied to you. Because the process is so thorough, it is usually impossible to apply body paint to an unwilling target unless that target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.</p><p>While most yroometji clans have body painting traditions spanning thousands of years, the patterning painted with body paint doesn't need to be exact to take effect; the entire container need only be applied to your body in a manner that you can envision. As a magic item, body paint doesn't wash off and can't be smeared or ruined unless you specifically want to remove it. Once you've activated the body paint, its magic leaves and it becomes mundane paint that can be washed away or smeared normally.</p>"

If fired from a weapon with the malfunction trait, an alchemical cartridge usually backfires onto you when you critically fail on an attack with the weapon, affecting you as if you were the intended target of the attack.

The skill check takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty and the DC to Escape from the weapon is reduced by 2. At the End of each round the weapon makes another grapple check using your athletics DC -2 as the result, increasing the penalty to the skill check and DC by 2 each round.. If you critically fail you are instead treated as if you had succeeded against grappling yourself for one round. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check.
