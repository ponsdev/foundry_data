Often disparagingly called kangaroo folk or simply roo folk, these comparisons are nonetheless accurate. Their squat ears stand at attention on the sides of their heads and they have long, slender faces with broad muzzles, beady eyes with irises running the same gamut of color as humans, and can grow mops of hair on their heads that they often grow out and style. The average yroometji sports powerful muscles in their digitigrade legs and tails, and their hands and feet sport sharp black nails, with those found on their feet being thick and sharp enough to disembowel foes with a properly aimed kick.</p>\n<p>Unlike kangaroos and similar creatures, both male and female yroometji possess a marsupial pouch on their lower abdomen. Because of this, yroometji lack many of the overt sexual dimorphisms of other humanoid races such as breasts and nipples, and as a result foreigners often struggle to tell male yroometjis apart from female yroometjis. A yroometji's pouch is capable of carrying approximately a cubic foot of volumn and approximately 20 pounds. Although yroometji mothers carry their infant children in their pouches until they're about 3 months old, most yroometji use their pouch more for the convenience of carrying small trinkets, favorite baubles, or light snacks around in it, much as a human would use a pocket sewn into their clothing.</p>\n<h3>Life Cycle</h3>\n<p>Yroometji children are born live after a gestation period of twelve months, transferred from within their mother's body directly into her pouch. Yroometjis spend the next three months completely dependent upon their mother, living exclusively within the pouch as they continue to grow and develop. Infant yroometjis are typically able to pull themselves out of their mother's pouches for the first time around three months of age, and once free from the pouch they develop quickly, gaining the ability to walk upright and hop sooner than their human peers thanks to their wide feet and broad tails. This proves a challenge for yroometji mothers, however, as their infant children often display an obsessive interest with exploring the outside world and are prone to hopping off on their own at the slightest provocation. Once a yroometji is free from the pouch, they grow and age much like human children, though they tend to acquire motor skills more quickly and develop physically at a slightly accelerated rate.</p>\n<p>Yroometjis possess powerful muscles in their hindquarters that enable them to jump vast distances with relative ease. Most yroometjis are able to leap as far as they could run by the time they're four years old, and yroometjis treat their children's first 30-foot bound as a milestone not unlike an infant human's first steps. As they age, yroometji culture emphasizes the use of leaping as opposed to simple running, as the former is seen as being more energy efficient than the latter. Skilled yroometjis are able to traverse vast distances with well-timed vertical jumps, a skill most adults deem essential to the walkabouts their children will undergo as adolescents.</p>\n<p>Yroometjis are physically mature after approximately 15 years, after which they age at the same rate as humans, living an average of 100 years. Nonbinary yroometji are commonplace, and while many such yroometji identify more with one gender over the other, most express a combination of masculinity and femininity.</p>\n<h3>Physiology</h3>\n<p>Yroometjis are warm-blooded creatures who stand approximately 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds on average. Although lithe in appearance, yroometjis have strong, muscular bodies capable of propelling themselves great distances into the air with practiced leaps. Their tail muscles in particular are strong enough that a yroometji can strike enemies with their tail with force comparable to that of a punch or a kick. Yroometjis have large eyes that are located on either side of a broad muzzle outfitted with a sensitive nose. They have digitigrade legs and feet with four toes each and leathery skin on their undersides, a noteworthy difference from the kangaroos to which yroometjis are often compared. Each of a yroometji's fingers and toes possesses a single black nail, though the nails on a yroometji's toes are significantly thicker and sharper than those on their hands, to the extent that many yroometji employ a unique martial arts style that allows them to disembowel their enemies using practiced kicks.</p>\n<p>Unlike many marsupials, all yroometjis possess a pouch on their lower abdomen If You're a Yroometji, You Likely&hellip; Are more comfortable expressing your emotions through physical contact as opposed to words. Respect nature and actively strive to protect it from harm. Keep strangers at arm's length, but actively seek physical intimacy with friends, family, and romantic partners. Have an array of personal items, including baubles and snacks, within your pouch. Enjoy exercising and playfully roughhouse with your friends and siblings. Value your people's traditions, but insist that they, like all living things, must be able to change if they are to persist through the ages. Others Probably&hellip; Mistake your body paintings as being part of your natural fur pattern. Believe that you're stuck in your ways and slow to adapt and change Expect you to move about solely by hopping from place to place and are surprised when they see you walking around at a leisurely pace. Are intimidated by your physique and misinterpret your flexibility as laziness. Think that you're ignorant due to your people's laxness towards book learning and long-standing tradition of passing their history down through oral storytelling. Frequently ask inane questions about your pouch, feet, and tail. of roughly the same size and shape. While some argue that the pouch is a vestigial structure for male yroometjis, yroometji culture strongly emphasizes the importance of all genders in the rearing of young, and it's common for yroometji men to carry younglings between the ages of 3 months and 6 months to a year in their pouches as necessary. A yroometji's pouch is both durable and flexible, although yroometjis often voice discomfort when storing their full capacity within their pouches. Young yroometji don't have pouches, as the pouch usually forms around an individual's 4th birthday.</p>\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n<p>Yroometji culture is intrinsically tied to their ancestral lands, which are typically marked by slow-changing geographic boundaries such as rivers, lakes, and mountains. Their lands form the foundation for all aspects of yroometji tribe's culture, for yroometjis are adaptive and resourceful folk capable of using whatever gifts their lands provide them with to survive and thrive.</p>\n<h3>Life</h3>\n<p>Yroometji are a jovial folk that observe an array of holidays based upon their traditional beliefs, especially the birth of their young. Unlike other races, who count birthdays from the moment a children is born, yroometjis consider their younglings unborn until the first time they pull themselves out of their mother's pouch. Since yroometji grow and develop for almost three months in infancy before this occurs, yroometji children are often roughly three months older then peers who were otherwise \"born\" on the same day as them, and even without this additional time spent developing in their mother's pouch, yroometjis are naturally stouter and develop faster than children of other races.</p>\n<p>In addition to birthdays, most yroometjis observe a coming of age ceremony known as a bora, in which a young yroometji is taught the sacred laws of their tribe, as well as the tribe's sacred songs, dances, and lore. Rather than being the name of the ceremony itself, 'bora' refers to the sacred site upon which the ceremony is held. All ancestral yroometji lands contain a hidden bora, a place of reverence where the boundaries between the material and spiritual worlds are thin. Once the rites have been properly learned, the youngling is sent on their first walkabout, a journey into the Spirit World in search of clarity or understanding. Younglings are sent without guidance or instruction, but nearly all yroometji return from this first walkabout having met their totem spirit and having gained a better understanding of themselves and their place in the world.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>Yroometjis often build small but respectable dwellings that make use of natural fauna and terrain, paying special care to integrate their homes with the land they settle in. For instance, a yroometji tribe dwelling in a savannah may elect to cover her home with dirt and grass seed to replace the grass she cleared in constructing her home, while a tribe living along the coast might decide to construct a floating village atop a multitude of barges to avoid sullying the pristine beauty of the shores. Most yroometji dwellings possess few rooms, electing instead for larger multipurpose spaces over smaller specialized ones. Exactly how these rooms are divided up depends largely on the individual, but most yroometjis have a single public room for entertaining guests and other group activities, a communal room that all family members share, a nursery used by all family members aged 14 years or younger, a private room for each mated pair of yroometjis living in the home, and two or more bathrooms. The public room is often used for relaxation and entertainment, while the communal room is used for preparing and eating meals, as well as family gatherings.</p>\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\n<p>Yroometji clothing is traditionally woven from plant fibers and animal hair taken from the creatures they hunt for food. Most yroometjis wear only what clothing is necessary to protect their modesty and their bodies from their environments, with favored outfits consisting of trousers and simple vests that allow the wearer access to their pouches. A yroometji's footpads are sturdy and resistant to most injuries, so they don't commonly wear shoes. In situations where shoes are necessary, however, yroometji footwear consists of simple laced boots that typically stretch from the tip of their toes to their knees. Yroometji shoes are usually open toed in order to allow the wearer to use their lethal kicks to full effect. Yroometjis commonly accessorize their outfits with jewelry made from crystal, polished rock, or carved bone, and favor wearing feathers and similar trappings when possible.</p>\n<h3>Communities &amp; Nations</h3>\n<p>Community life is among the most important of yroometji virtues, as they tend to live in small settlements of as few as 30 yroometjis to as many of 400 or 500. Yroometjis view the community as a living, breathing organism in its own right and strive to make sure that every part of their communities is healthy and functioning properly. Villagers regularly band together to help feed the hungry, house the homeless, and care for the sick whenever necessary, and every member of a yroometji community is expected to provide for the greater good of the community in some manner. Yroometji communities are most often led by seasoned elders, though younger yroometjis can join their local council of elders through simple merit. In general, yroometji settlements tend to be closed off to outsiders, even yroometjis of other villages, although this practice has been increasingly challenged by younger yroometjis who see the wider world and its inhabitants as a larger community that their people are intentionally keeping themselves apart from, rather than a place to be kept at arm's length.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Yroometji is among the oldest known languages spoken by mortals, and is best known for its extremely dense rules for pronoun usage. In addition to having male, female, and neutral pronouns, Yroometji also has pronouns for subjects that are simultaneously male and female, as well as pronouns that denote subjects that are sometimes male and sometimes female. It's customary in Yroometji to use a neutral pronouns for young children, objects, and someone you've just met until that individual designates an appropriate gendered pronoun to use for them, if any. Yroometjis are often named after physical occurrences in nature, and include Anmaroo, Balumn, Corola, Delferru, Girro, Jesjiru, Kalti, Malwe, Najinnu, Qedomoro, Ruvro, Salmeri, Xvecae, and Ysmira.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Yroometji cuisine largely consists of animals and plants that can be foraged from the surrounding environment, including many types of crab, insects, shrimp, and wild fruits like berries and nuts. Yroometji food is often heavily seasoned and cooked directly upon an open fire, using techniques like baking, braising, grilling, roasting, and smoking. Given that fire is such an integral part of yroometji cooking, fuel for that fire is considered as important an ingredient for a meal as the meal itself, and different types of woods and grasses are selected based upon the desired taste of the food. Most yroometjis cook their food in their home's fireplaces, but just as many build specialized ovens from mud bricks capable of properly utilizing their time-honored cooking traditions. Yroometjis with a particular aptitude or fondness for cooking may have as many of four different ovens in various places across their homes, and most villages have a communal space where food can be publicly cooked using massive smokers and other specialized cooking devices. Famous yroometji dishes included shri'vegga, which consisted of grilled shrimp and vegetables spread across a wild rice pilaf, and avulna which consists of a full colony of ants that have been drowned in barbecue sauce, harvested, and grilled until they pop. The resulting mixture is then mixed with rice and drizzled atop vegetables, fruit, and meat that are first roasted on a skewer over an open fire.</p>\n<h3>Relations With Others</h3>\n<p>Yroometjis are sociable folk who get along well with foreigners, especially those with ties to the spirits. They make fast friends with catfolk and kitsune, and are very accepting of open-minded humans. They respect the ancient rites of dwarves, although the yroometji culture of peace and spiritual growth clashes spectacularly with the dwarf traditions regarding honor and warfare. As much of yroometji spirituality centers around learning to coexist harmoniously with nature, they do not get along with societies that blatantly pollute or defile nature.</p>\n<h3>Trade</h3>\n<p>Yroometjis tend to primarily practice trades deemed necessary for meeting their basic needs, such as agriculture, tailoring, and construction. Many yroometjis garden or otherwise tend to small patches of land where they can assure themselves some regular supply of food, trading baubles and knickknacks made from animals, plants, colorful stones, and crystals for what they can't gather themselves. Foreigners value yroometjis for their practiced orienteering abilities, and yroometjis are often willing to act as guides for visitors in exchange for compensation, as this allows them to earn money for something they legitimately enjoy doing while also keeping an eye on foreigners who might defile their lands, whether accidentally or intentionally.</p>\n<h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>\n<p>Several notable ethnic groups exist among yroometji, as noted below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drendroo:</strong> At home in tropical climates, drendroo yroometjis are best known for building tree house communities on tropical islands. Their fur ranging in shades of ruddy brown to fulvous, drendroos are of average yroometji build and have thinner tails to compensate. Their culture abhors violence and promotes pacifism whenever 08 possible, and they're among the most friendly of yroometjis to foreigners.</li>\n<li><strong>Gongroo:</strong> Largely secluded from other species, gongroo yroometjis dwell primarily in arid plains and savannas. Although usually average in size, individual gongroos can be much taller than the average yroometji with sturdy builds from having been forced to survive in their harsh homes. Gongroos keep to themselves whenever possible, and restrict foreigner access to much of their settlements.</li>\n<li><strong>Lawlaroo:</strong> Found primarily in temperate forests and marshes, lawlaroo yroometjis are have squat bodies, slightly shorter than the average yroometji but thicker overall. Among the most widely distributed of yroometjis, lawlaroos often find themselves incorporated into foreigner settlements where they act as nature guides. Many lawlaroos have longer fur on the tips of their tails that grows into a fluffy tassel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Origins</h2>\n<p>According to yroometji legends, before all gods and divinities, the ancestors existed. These powerful, benign spirits were half mortal and resembled humanoid aspects of the world they were to create-animals, plants, even humans and yroometji. As the ancestors toiled, magic left their bodies and suffused the land with life and drew souls into their creations. When the work had ended, the ancestors were left with mere echoes of the mighty powers they once commanded, but for their sacrifice the land teemed with life and magic. Taking pride in their endeavors, the ancestors settled upon the worlds that they had built for themselves and became the fathers and mothers of the mortal races.</p>\n<p>Such was the case with the yroometji, whose ancestors created the kangaroo and the wallaby and shaped the very lands upon which they lived. After a lifetime of creation, the yroometji ancestors settled down upon the lands upon which they had created and bore children-the first yroometjis. As their children grew, the yroometji showed them not only how to hunt and fight, but also how to gather food and respect the natural world. But before their children were fully grown, the yroometji ancestors' magic faded, their life essence spent. Overtaken by grief, the first yroometji resolved to pass from the material world into the spiritual one, hoping to find the souls of their ancestors and return them to their cold bodies. What they found was more splendid then they could have ever imagined, for in the Spirit World, their ancestors were not old and frail, but alive and teeming with magic. It was there that the first yroometji were taught the great secrets of their people-ancient songs, stories, and dances-as well as how to best protect the legacy of their ancestors. It was a lesson that the first yroometji vowed never to forget, and so they passed on those lessons to each of their children, and their children's children, forevermore.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_yroometji"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-11-20T02:50:51.303-05:00","version":{"schema":0.669,"foundry":"0.8.9","system":"2.19.0.9009"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha"]},"1":{"value":["con"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["int"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"Yroometji"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"6hr7c":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"xr7xgiJEKs2FNlu1","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items/pathfinders-pouch.webp","name":"Pouch (Yroometji)","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GXEZnFwcNKsD0g4o":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Ancestries.01P8bmzzl6k2ecXt"}}}
{"_id":"6HUKvzXaXDEU7s4r","name":"Pnoll","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/direwolf.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>The sound of padding paws in the night, a tree branch creaking under weight, the snuffling nose in the rubbish heap-these are signs that a pnoll is near. Pnolls are hardy, resourceful, clever, and a bit hapless; they generally like to avoid attention, preferring instead to just do their own thing. Nomadic and nocturnal, they travel through settlements under the moonlight, collecting useful refuse.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Because pnolls keep to themselves and typically move about only at night, not many other people even know about them. Their independence means they rarely form long-term bonds, but they're agreeable and easygoing enough to be excellent companions... most of the time. They tend to have great patience for most things, but a few pet peeves make them swiftly turn grumpy. These usually have to deal with someone intruding upon their personal space, chiding them for their hygiene, being wasteful, or talking incessantly.</p>\n<p>Though they do have qualities suited for the adventuring life, they seldom waddle into danger voluntarily. Danger and conflict are exhausting and best avoided, they believe. However, most pnolls have good hearts, and may find themselves pulled into fraught situations, despite their better judgment.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is independent, down-to-earth, odd, occasionally cantankerous, and a little gross, you should play a pnoll.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide helpful, practical life advice, sometimes sounding like an overbearing parent or relative.</li>\n<li>Get annoyed at others' wastefulness or greed.</li>\n<li>Quickly concede your points in a conversation or debate, preferring to keep things chill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your clever and practical planning.</li>\n<li>Don't like watching you sift through trash, and encourage you to bathe. With water. And soap.</li>\n<li>Get annoyed when your nocturnal wandering and snacking wakes them in the middle of the night.</li>\n<li>Pronounce it \"nol\" instead of the proper \"PUH-nol.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stocky with wide bellies and hunched posture, most standing between 4'7\" and 5'5\". Their naked tails extend about 4\" long, and pnolls tend to either let them drag along behind them or curl them in close to the body to be inconspicuous. Pnolls are rugged and accustomed to the hardships of the road, making them particularly hardy.</p>\n<p>Every pnoll has a pouch on their abdomen, built for storing newborn joeys. A pnoll's pouch can contain around a dozen young, and feed them with teats on the interior of the pouch. Actually sustaining that many at once is a hardship for the parent, hence the pnoll saying, \"May your litter be modest.\" Pnolls living in a group might pass joeys from the parent to another carrier. The \"pouch papa\" regards this as an annoyance, but a necessary one. When not carrying young, pnolls find all sorts of other uses for this convenient pouch, such as storing food, hiding items, or warming their hands.</p>\n<p>Pnolls gestate for only a couple months before being born. Joeys spend the first few months living in their parent's pouch, until they're too heavy to carry. Pnolls reach maturity at around 7 years old and can live to 90 years or older. The aged are especially revered, even more so if they've become gnarled or scarred over their years.</p>\n<p>A pnoll's fur is thick and warm, mostly gray and white. Typically, a pnoll has some patches of black, especially around the ears, hands and feet. This fur can be quite soft, provided it's not soiled with mud or spilled food and drink.</p>\n<p>Pnolls' resemblance to opossums causes some outsiders to call them \"opossumfolk.\" Pnolls refuse to use this name on the grounds that it's too many syllables.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Pnolls happily find community where they can, but they rarely regard such occurrences as permanent. Pnolls don't have a high opinion of organized humanoid societies-they think everyone is trash. In fact, this cultural misanthropy is the closest thing pnolls have to a fundamental philosophy. This stems from a humble nature rather than disdain or cynicism, for if everyone is trash, there's no reason for anyone to act superior over another. Pnolls value trash, but they don't see any reason to elevate it. This makes them pragmatic and down-to-earth, focused primarily on survival. The rare pnoll that finds a comfortable life attributes it to good luck rather than personal worth, and shares any excess beyond what they need with their fellows. They get along well with other modest people, especially halflings, and love to share stories, meals, and a warm campfire.</p>\n<p>Pnolls don't share one monolithic culture. Most of their wisdom comes in the form of adages or parables passed down within their families. Often these stories feature some distant-likely made up-family member who learned a painful lesson through their own foolishness.</p>\n<p>Inventive and frugal, pnolls root through waste piles and trade for damaged goods that could be made functional again with simple repairs. Pnolls' sense of taste isn't strong, so they also consume old food that isn't quite spoiled. This part of the pnoll lifestyle can put them at odds with overly stringent laws of big cities. This means pnolls often stop in at a big city briefly to collect the high-quality refuse of the wasteful wealthy before traveling on to smaller communities with less waste but less uptight social structures. Some of them, though, find a place as a rag-and-bone trader, though the moment they have to deal with red tape or getting some kind of city license they usually move on rather than deal with the hassle.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Pnolls as a people have good intentions but little comprehension of laws that don't protect people from harm. This means most of them are neutral good or chaotic good.</p>\n<p>When it comes to worship, they choose what they like of a god's tenets and reject the rest. For instance, even a good pnoll might appreciate that Lamashtu is a mother who supports the downtrodden while disliking her exhortation of corruption, essentially taking one lesson away while ignoring the rest of the deity's edicts. Most people more invested in organized religion find this incomprehensible, and they don't believe the pnoll is worshipping the deity at all.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pnoll names stay short-often just one or two syllables-with a sound that either falls, then rises or that drops flat like sputum hocked onto pavement. They tend to refer to people as \"Sam,\" a term comparable to \"buddy,\" including people whose names they don't yet know. Likewise, \"Sams\" refers to a group of people or a litter of pnolls.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Doke, Fef, Grodette, Hud, Hurba, Narnee, Umpa, Plod, Purg, Sport, Stoo, Tankle, Thoda</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_pnoll"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-11-20T02:50:51.305-05:00","version":{"schema":0.661,"foundry":"0.8.9","system":"2.19.0.9009"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["cha"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"pnoll"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["goblin","halfling","orcish","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{"3do5h":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"AZUUT9C8EVVdCjIP","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/belt-pouch.webp","name":"Pouch","level":0}},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.EzP5nAaDaYVaoxID"}}}

Folklore is riddled with tales of their beauty, omens for seaboard ships, and secret mysticism. In reality, they rarely surface, keeping their secrets from surface dwellers. Their own folklore filled with talk of magical invasions, betrayal, and kidnapping cause by association with land-walkers. Merfolk protect their waters fiercely, patrolling wide swaths of water and keeping the locations of their settlements a secret. If seaward travelers are lost or seem nonthreatening kinder merfolk will warn them away. However, if they seem like a threat or fail to take heed, merfolk will make the first strike and attack ruthlessly, often sinking any vessel.</p>\n<p>Merfolk communities are often in constant conflict with sea devils (sahuagin) and hold a timeless fear of alghollthu influence. This has lead to a great deal of preparedness among the merfolk, most are martially trained and see a fair amount of conflict in their lives in the defense of their people. Prideful of their heritage, living art, and military prowess, merfolk refuse to be taken lightly.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find those unfamiliar with your way of life as untrustworthy, or at least naive.</li>\n<li>Place as much importance on martial might as you do in artistic and musical ability.</li>\n<li>Take it upon yourself to act first where others would delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find you mystifying or terrifying depending on the tales they've been told.</li>\n<li>Think you are a bit cold unless they gain your trust.</li>\n<li>Be shocked at your readiness in violent situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Merfolk are elegant and graceful, resembling humanoids from the waist up but with the fins and tails of massive fish from the waist down. Their skin tones range among all human tones including some having blue or green tints, and their aquatic parts can be of nearly any color found in the sea. Some have particularly translucent skint such as deepwater merfolk that is beautiful but a bit unsettling as it allows seeing of their internal organs. Most merfolk's hair is actually white, black, or transluscent. However, they cultivate a mutualistic relationship with algaes, sponges, planktons, and other microorganisms to express a truly staggering array of colors and even bioluminescence. Rarely, some sport chromatophores to change the various chromatic features of their bodies at will. As far as their tails go, merfolk sport a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and fin arrangements, with a few rarer kinds sporting more serpentine tales or even tentacles!</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Merfolk society is secretive, kept away from other societies and peoples as a defense against dark forces and the greed and envy of others. Within their submerged communities, carved from soft stone, shaped with coral, and cemented with modified silt, merfolk rely on this natural surroundings as camouflage against would be invaders. Merfolk try and find beauty in all things they do, from cultivating various forms of tiny organisms to make living color coatings and lights to naturally shaping corals, sponges, and bivalves into captivating shapes and colors. But above all of these they value music, most commonly singing, though some attempt to master what few instruments function underwater. Great performing artists are held high with the same social regard as the patrolling heroes that keep them safe. Even when they travel beyond, merfolk have a great respect for musicians, singers, and guardians with the good of their people in mind. While most merfolk would prefer to be a peaceful people, those communities that have attempted this have either vanished, been slaughtered, or have cut ties with the other merfolk, leaving the effects of their attempts a mystery. Lone merfolk travel the seas as well, either being outcasts, or having been the survivor of a sea devil raid, such wanderers rarely care where they end up, just seeking anything but a painful past.</p>\n<h3>Alignment and religion</h3>\n<p>Merfolk can be of any alignment but as a society gravitate toward true neutral, doing what needs to be done when the time comes. Many merfolk live in tandem with their environments, respecting nature and many become druids or rangers. As denizens of the sea many also worship sea gods and revile the gods of sea devils like Dagon.</p>\n<h3>Names</h3>\n<p>Merfolk names tend to be aquan words denoting beauty or strength.

{"_id":"EoGf9oVFWKqYxwCR","name":"Rabbitfolk","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/rabbit-head.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Rabbitfolk are curious people who have a knack for getting into and out of trouble. They are especially sociable and keep close friends.

They have an innate curiosity that can sometimes get them into trouble. They like to set out into the world to find new experiences to better understand the world and the people that inhabit it. Rabbitfolk believe that a pursuit of knowledge is helpful in their way of life and will often share the knowledge they learn with loved ones.</p>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are curious and clever humanoids that are prone to fits of exploration and discovery. Their curiosity is supported by an almost lack of social inhibitions. They have no issue or shame with asking questions that others would consider foolish or rude. Additionally, this curiosity instills a desire to seek out new experiences, a desire that can sometimes be detrimental. Most rabbitfolk have a tale of a friend or relative that ended up getting hurt or worse simply because they \"might be the first rabbit that ever did it.\"</p>\n<p>This propensity for danger is mitigated by a rabbitfolk's speed and agility. This feature, combined with their ability to quickly recognize danger, allows many rabbitfolk to elude harm, even in situations that would be dire to most others. The rabbitfolk habit of escaping danger has earned them a reputation for being thrill seekers and trouble makers.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is always wanting to learn, outgoing, and quick of wit and foot, you should play a rabbitfolk.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an almost insatiable desire to learn.</li>\n<li>Allow your curiosity to lead you into dangerous situations.</li>\n<li>Analyze situations to put you at the greatest advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you fickle and erratic.</li>\n<li>Believe that you have multiple solutions to every problem and answer to every situation.</li>\n<li>Assume you will provide unwanted facts and details, even when not prompted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are tall, lithe beings with long ears, whiskers, and short tails. Their short fur typically runs shades of white, gray, brown, and black. Most rabbitfolk stand a little more than 5 feet tall from their feet to the top of their heads. Rabbitfolk ears add some extra height, with most ears spanning a few inches in length and some ears reaching as tall as one foot. Not all rabbitfolk ears stand tall, however, and some rabbitfolk instead have ears that flop down against their head.</p>\n<p>Rabbitfolk age at a similar rate to humans, save that infant rabbitfolk can walk after only a few months. Most rabbitfolk can live to be up to 80 years of age. Thanks to their thinner frames, most rabbitfolk weigh the same as humans of similar, lean builds. Rabbitfolk clothing is typically form fitting and light to allow for the greatest range of movement, though older rabbitfolk tend toward looser clothing. Rabbitfolk forgo footwear, instead relying on their own bare feet through most terrain. These feet develop hard pads that can defend against the elements as well as any shoe.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Known to themselves as malivars, rabbitfolk are a generally sociable people. Community is central to rabbitfolk culture. Malivar settlements have fluid social dynamics where most rabbitfolk share in aspects of each other's lives. Rabbitfolk children visit and stay at other homes for extended periods of times, whether or not they have any relation. Homes will include two or three malivar families at once, each sharing in their resources. At any given time, a rabbitfolk home might have several outsiders including other rabbitfolk from the same settlement, traveling rabbitfolk, and outsiders of other ancestries. This constant intermingling reinforces cooperation among malivar communities.</p>\n<p>The common rabbitfolk curiosity pushes many rabbitfolk toward scholarly pursuits. Researchers, teachers, and chroniclers are common among rabbitfolk. Rabbitfolk tend to keep written and oral histories that contain entire generations worth of knowledge. This practice is common among rabbitfolk of all kinds, regardless of vocation. Rabbitfolk farmers keep decades of weather patterns, cooks have hundreds of recipes, and warriors keep chronicles of great battles and specific tactics.</p>\n<p>Other ancestries sometimes have trouble keeping up with malivars. A rabbitfolk's mind is constantly changing focus and keeping track of multiple lines of thought at once, which can make discussions with a rabbitfolk difficult. To a rabbitfolk, the multitude of ideas is easy enough to sort out in the moment, but to others it can feel like a chaotic mess of disparate thoughts with no obvious connections. This experience can lead many non-rabbitfolk to believe that rabbitfolk are people incapable of focusing on a single task. In reality, most rabbitfolk like to approach a given goal from multiple angles and consider several possibilities for success.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are inclined to help others and consider ways in supporting their close friends. As a result, many rabbitfolk are good. They have no particular leanings toward chaos or law, as their intermingling societies require an understanding of unwritten social rules, but these same social rules constantly bend and change as families grow and shrink. Even rabbitfolk with an affinity toward neutrality or evil have a close-knit group of allies. Rare is the rabbitfolk without friends.</p>\n<p>Due to their curiosity, many rabbitfolk worship gods of knowledge or creativity. They also worship gods of travel or luck to aid them in their journeys of discovery. Rabbitfolk focused on cooperation also tend to follow gods of aid, community, and healing.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Newborn rabbitfolk don't receive individual names. Instead, an entire litter will receive a title such as \"Warren Swarm,\" \"Little Stars,\" or \"Seedlings.\" The members of the litter learn to respond as a group to the title until they grow to be old enough to travel unsupervised within their own settlement, usually at three or four years of age. At this point, the community provides possible names to the parents based on what the individual rabbitfolk inspires among their neighbors.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the parent and child work together to choose two names, their \"life\" name and their \"warren\" name. The child chooses the life name that best fits their perception of themselves and is prone to change throughout a lifetime. The warren name is similar to a family name or surname and most parents choose the same warren name for all of their children, though a warren name might differ in cases where a rabbitfolk seems more at home with other families.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alpo, Burrow-blade, Charrniss, Greensong, Hallind, Lightfoot, Mossfer, Nulaniss, Rontor, Snowcharm, Tallim, Youngmoon</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_rabbitfolk"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-11-20T02:50:51.307-05:00","version":{"schema":0.664,"foundry":"0.8.9","system":"2.19.0.9009"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["wis"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"Rabbitfolk"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["dwarven","elven","gnomish","halfling","sylvan","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Ancestries.EoGf9oVFWKqYxwCR"}}}
{"_id":"OQmPgDZl97pzUaZa","name":"Mephian","type":"ancestry","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/ancestry.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Known for being a relaxed, community-focused people, mephians have long-faced prejudice from other races due to their strong resemblance to skunks and their ability to secrete a similarly pungent musk. They are hardy folk who strongly value empathy and communal governing, but even as relations between mephians and other races have improved, mephian culture continues to emphasize the importance of building relationships with outsiders slowly with caution that often borders paranoia.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>It's fairly simple to see why mephians are often called \"skunk folk\", as they possess thick, darkly colored fur in shades of black, umber, or gray. Each mephian has a distinct pattern of white markings on their fur located on the top of their head, down their necks and across the front of their torso, down to their nether regions and up their backs, culminating in fanciful stripe patterns that run down the middle of their thick, distinctive tails. Mephians possess plantigrade legs and five-fingered hands, each of their digits possessing small but sharp nails. Teardrop-shaped ears sit atop their large heads, which possess pronounced muzzles and keen noses. The entirety of the bottom of a mephian's foot, as well as the palms and bottom portions of their fingers are furless, instead possessing thick, leathery padding.</p>\n<p>All mephians possess the ability to secrete a unique musk that nearly all living creatures find revolving. Contrary to what many believe, the glands that mephians use to secrete their musk are located in their tail as opposed to their posterior, where such glands are located in skunks. Rather than spray their musk, mephians use their tails to lather their musk onto their opponents, essentially smearing it onto them like sweat. The end result is the same, however, for a mephian's musk is repulsively pungent to nearly all living creatures.</p>\n<h3>Life Cycle</h3>\n<p>Mephians birth their children live after a gestation period of nine months, with most pregnancies resulting in a single newborn. At birth, young mephians are both blind and deaf, these senses typically developing fully three weeks after the mephian is born. Mephian children grow at approximately the same rate as human children, though they tend to be somewhat hardier then their peers thanks to the thick fur that covers their bodies, which acts as natural padding from injury. Their fur gives young mephians a certain sense of invulnerability, and mephian children, adolescents, and even adults are fond of physical roughhousing as play, provided no one gets hurt.</p>\n<p>While mephians possess numerous rites of passage similar to those of humans, one significant rite of passage that all mephians undertake is learning how to control their tail's musk glands, which typically occurs by three years of age. Prior to this, mephian younglings have little control over their body's production of musk, causing their glades to release the musk as soon as their body creates it. This often makes caring for mephian young revolting for non-mephians, though special ointment is available that temporarily blocks a mephian from secreting their musk, similar to an antiperspirant. Controlling one's musk glands is simply a matter of practice and muscle control, however, and usually several days of practice is enough for most mephians to master this skill.</p>\n<p>Mephians are physically mature after approximately 18 years, after which they age roughly at the same rate of humans, living an average of 100 years. Mephians are almost always bisexual, though many prefer partners of a specific sex.</p>\n<h3>If You're a Mephian, You Likely...</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer to spend time in good company, especially with fellow mephians</li>\n<li>Are stoic and able to work for a while before tiring.</li>\n<li>Zealously value your childhood community and family, as well as those that you view as true friends.</li>\n<li>Enjoy spending most of your time among friends and families and engaging in hobbies that you cultivated during your youth.</li>\n<li>Empathize well with others, even those you just met.</li>\n<li>Know a great deal about a specific niche that you've likely been interested in since you were a very young child or toddler.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Others Probably...</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume your musk is secreted from your posterior.</li>\n<li>Suspect that despite your kind words that you're actually heartless and unsympathetic to the plights of others.</li>\n<li>Expect you to constantly reek of an awful odor.</li>\n<li>Believe that you rely solely on your musk to defend yourself in combat and are surprised if you know how to fit.</li>\n<li>Fear that you'll spray them with your musk at the smallest slight or grievance.</li>\n<li>Frequently ask to pet your fur or tail because of how fluffy it looks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Physiology</h3>\n<p>Mephians are warm-blooded creatures who, on average, stand just shy of 6 feet in height weigh a hefty 200 pounds. Approximately half of a mephian's weight comes from their thick fur, with the average mephian's tail weighing nearly 40% of their combined weight in total. They have teardrop shaped eyes with bright irises ranging similarly to humans in coloration, plantigrade feet with stubby nails, and a tail toughly the length of their legs whose long, thick, and shaggy fur accounts for the majority of its bulk. They secrete their infamous musk from numerous glands located in the pores of their tails' skin. Rather than possessing the ability to release each gland individually, mephians release all glands simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Mephians have sharp noses and a refined sense of taste, but their vision is often somewhat lacking. They struggle at seeing long distances and often need glasses or contacts to have the same visual acuity as a human. Most mephians prefer the least obtrusive method of medical care, and don't see the point in costly and potentially dangerous corrective vision procedures when an inexpensive trinket will do the trick.</p>\n<p>The mephian reproductive cycle revolves around a female mephian's estrous cycle, which is sensitive to fluctuations in the magnetic field of their current world of residence. This translates to approximately one cycle per month, but it can be more or less intense due to environmental factors like solar flares, whose effects on magnetic fields can trigger months-long periods of receptiveness. In response to this inconvenience, mephians have been alchemically controlling their ancestry's estrous cycle for millennia using pheromone-absorbing women's garments and medicinals designed to regulate the male libido in 12-hour cycles. Yet even when such preventative measures aren't used, mephian culture strongly emphasizes that pheromones aren't consent, and every mephian is expected to practice self control in the presence of a woman experiencing her estrous cycle.</p>\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n<p>Mephian culture emphasizes the important of community, self-sacrifice, and empathy towards others, yet mephians themselves are often cold to those they've just met and slow to befriend others despite the warmness they share with friends and family. They believe in hard work, equality, and free love, viewing them as pillars of society. That having been said, mephians are scrappy folk used to fighting for their rights and have no qualms with entering battles of words or weapons to defend what they view to be just.</p>\n<h3>Life</h3>\n<p>Mephians are well-known for their unique child- rearing practices, many of which other races find bizarre. Among the most noteworthy is their people's tendency to swap custody over their children for years at a time, a tradition going back centuries. Around the mephian's 8th birthday, they become eligible for custodial swap, during which the child is passed over to another financially stable adult to be fostered for a year or longer. This allows childless adults in the community to experience what it's like to have children while giving those with children a break from child rearing (or rearing that specific child, at least). Participation in custodial swapping isn't mandatory, but the community often incentivise it by creating healthcare pools and similar benefits for participants.</p>\n<p>While swaps can be completely random, they usually aren't. Biological parents can request their biological children back at any time, and have limited pools of \"vacation time\" that allow them to trade their children while receiving none in return. Parents can also request specific children and swap amongst themselves, although systems that reward parents for taking children who exhibit significant problem behaviors and various disorders exist to ensure that all parents get to reap the benefits of allowing the village to raise each child. Young mephians also have a say in who they're swapped to, and the committees that run the swap are vigilant in ensuring the safety of the children during these events. Traditionally, child swaps only occur between mephians, though no precedent preventing non-mephians from participating exists.</p>\n<p>Mephians believe in family beyond blood, the communal bonds that protect and provide for one another. Most mephians care for the safety and well-being of their community, be it ten souls or ten- thousand, as they would their own flesh and blood. It's often difficult to determine where mephian bloodlines begin and end, as mephians are prone to adopting others into their blood families, creating massive webs of interlocking families based squarely on friendships and personal connections. Although rare, its completely possible for a mephian to drag friends of other races into their extended families in this manner too, though anyone brought into a mephian's extended family is expected to prove themselves and their devotion to the community at large. The approval of a mephian community can be a fickle thing, which is one reason why many mephians work so hard to stay in their families' good graces.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>Mephian architecture favors the use of wood and stone in harmony, often colored in simple, bold palettes that evoke natural themes such as spring or summer. Rooms are open, airy, and usually have some means of allowing plenty of natural sunlight to enter, be it floor-to-ceiling windows or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} skylights. Whereas other races build up, mephians prefer to build down, often entertaining guests on ground floor levels while keeping their private quarters nestled away underground. This style keeps their underground chambers dimly lit and insulated, making sleeping chambers warmer during the winter and cooler during summer. Mephian bedrooms usually feature a large communal room where families can sleep together that is connected to separate, private chambers for each individual. While mephians will use these chambers when ill or seeking solitude, in mephian culture seeking private sleeping arrangements with another often carries the connotation of sexual encounters.</p>\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\n<p>Despite their race possessing the means to mass produce clothing if they wanted to, mephian clothing tends to be hand-sewn using traditional materials supplemented by technological processes. This means that while mephians will use state of the art techniques to weave and treat cloth, they often insist upon sewing their clothing by hand to ensure that the stitch work is just right. Mephian clothing tends to be soft, comfortable, and designed primarily to associate the wearer with ideas like \"boldness\", \"cuteness\", or \"mysteriousness\". This is largely because mephian fur is generally warm enough to allow mephians to exist comfortably in all but the most extreme climates on Terros, so the average mephian doesn't need to wear clothing for environmental protection. In contrast, fashion is extremely important to mephians and mephian culture, and they have their own fashion trends that may run in tandem with those of one ancestral group one day and change dramatically several days later. Most mephians love clothing and most consider receiving a well-made outfit that suits one's personality or interests to be an extremely thoughtful and considerate gift.</p>\n<h3>Communities &amp; Nations</h3>\n<p>Mephians each hold a specialized rule in their community, and most mephians look to proven leaders for leadership, proven spiritual leaders for spiritual guidance, and so on. While more than willing to lean on one another, they have trouble following the advice of those who haven't proven themselves and their intentions to the community. Those found capable of leading a mephian community are known as councilfolx, as much of a title of respect as a professional. Councilfolx preside over community policy for as long as their community supports them, and new elections to replace councilfolx are called by majority decree, an event that usually marks the end of that councilfolx's political career. As a result, those wishing to be career councilfolx find themselves faced with ceaseless pressure to avoid provoking the ire of those they govern.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Traditional mephian cuisine relies heavily on root vegetables, especially potatoes and other tubers, as well as a variety of spices that are used to season their meat and greens. Traditional dishes usually find a way to incorporate nuts and berries, with most mephians pairing fruits to their entrees as elves pair wine. While mephians will eat meats from animals like chickens, cows, and pigs, traditional mephian fare often uses meat taken from giant amphibians, arthropods, reptiles, and worms, and commonly eat grubs, larvae, and the eggs of such creatures. In the case of insects, adult crickets, beetles, and similar creatures toasted with a variety of species and eaten in a manner similar to bacon bites in salads and on larger meats, such as those taken from lizards or giant salamanders. One upscale mephian dish is known as Iszarbee, which consists of a lizard fillet marinated in chilli and spice for 56 hours that is served atop rice with befswan, which consists of popling beetles that are soaked in wine, then roasted until their exoskeletons pop. The dish is considered exquisite by culinary experts despite how squeamish many humans become at the thought of its ingredients.</p>\n<h3>Relations With Others</h3>\n<p>Although empathic as a people, mephians are somewhat cold to outsiders that they don't know personally. This paranoid guard that many mephians have towards others creates a barrier to forming a friendship that is difficult for many to overcome, though those who win over a mephian's heart find a true friend willing to go to great lengths to support them. Surprisingly, dwarves respect a mephian's reservations, a move that is often the first, positive step towards long-lasting friendships. They're guarded when dealing with kitsune, believing stereotypes that paint them as thieves, tricksters, and home-wreckers, and find elves detached from reality. Mephians find humans unpredictable on account of their diversity and myriad of cultures and creeds.</p>\n<h3>Trade</h3>\n<p>Mephians are hardworking individuals who never shy away from physical labor, and as a result they often occupy trades and professions that others find grueling or physically exhausting, especially if those jobs involve working or living off of the land in some way. Farming, fishing, lumbering, hunting, and quarrying are all respected mephian professions for this reason, as are trades that use natural materials to create fine products. Mephian cooks are particularly well- received both by members of a mephian community and non-mephians, and trades like carpentry, construction, and sculpting</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Mephians primarily speak Mephian, an old language that shares an alphabet with Common despite having substantially different pronunciations, as syllables are accented differently in Mephian. Additionally, Mephian is famous for being among the world's oldest languages to not only have three separately gendered pronouns-one male, one female, and one neutral- but also use gender neutral pronouns for all subjects by default unless the subject's gender is known.</p>\n<p>Mephian names are traditional, focusing on very romantic-sounding sounds and words that relate back to personality traits or famous rulers. Mephians commonly nickname their friends and dear ones, but consider it rude to use anything but one's full and proper name without permission.</p>\n<p>Several common mephian names include Aleamme, Arel, Avenya, Bialicia, Denyeson, Emalot, Eubertus, Eugarita, Flourva, Halyebaul, Lealelt, Maysant, Millina, Niel, Racildis, Rerviace, Rueaux, Theomelina, Vyllemin, and Ysolt.</p>\n<h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>\n<p>Several notable ethnic groups exist among mephians, as noted below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aposesian:</strong> Relatively lithe compared to the average mephian, aposesian mephians commonly live in rocky or hilly terrain, and possess a total of four strips that run the length of their bodies and tail-two stripes that cross their backs horizontally around their midriffs and as many as four that drape down their backs. To the average viewer, an aposesian mephian's stripes resemble spots, which causes some to refer to them as spotted mephians. Aposesian mephian culture values action and assertiveness more than other mephian cultures, and they have a reputation for being hot- headed despite their empathetic tendencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Lembulgi:</strong> Native to arid climates, lembulgi are best known for their wide, squat noses and their monochrome fur. Unlike other mephians, who are distinctly striped, lembulgi mephians have white fur on their backs and black fur on their fronts. As one might expect, a lembulgi mephian's squat nose is keener then that of other mephians, and is coarse to the touch. When using their musk, a lembulgi's coarse fur often stands on edge as their musk glands open, giving the tail a weapon-like appearance.</li>\n<li><strong>Scanganku:</strong> When the typical individual pictures a mephian, they often picture a scanganku simply because scanganku mephians often have fur patterns that best mirror the common skunk, their backs and tails completely white save for a thick, black stripe that runs straight down the middle of this marking. Scanganku communities are often tightly-knit even among mephian standards, and while fiercely loyal many communities closely guard themselves against foreigners to the point of xenophobia.</li>\n<li><strong>Ultaxi:</strong> Lacking much of the average mephian's fluffy fur, ultaxi mephians have short, bristly fur and a single, well-defined white stripe that stretches from the base of the back of their necks all the way to tip of their tails, which can be up to half as long when compared to other mephian ethnic groups. Ultaxi mephians are sometimes called island mephians because their communities are native to oceanic islands, their thinner fur an adaptation for tropical heat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Origins</h2>\n<p>Mephian mythology is somewhat sparse compared to the myths of other species, as most mephians don't feel particularly compelled to ask questions like \"Where did we come from\" or \"Why are we here\". The stories that do exist tend to posit the idea that true to their appearance, the first mephians were formed from skunks that had been blessed by ancient nature spirits with wisdom and sapience. In many ways, mephian creation myths are remarkably similar to those of the yroometji, though few modern mephians pay much mind to them now.</p>\n<p>As far as religion goes, the closest thing that the mephians have to a patron deity is Bethsarion. In life, Bethsarion was a mephian philosopher who posited that while deities existed and were powerful, they are not worthy of mortal worship on the grounds that they do very little to assist mortals in their day to day lives. When Bethsarion died, Zeus, the Cosmic Ruler in those days, nailed the philosopher to the Wall of the Forlorn, the final resting place of all atheist souls, and christened him the Atheist God. After his captor was cast down by other deities, Bethsarion was freed from the Wall and granted the powers and privileges of a demigod, charged with watching over the souls of atheists so that they too would receive a final reward.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_mephian"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":null},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Mephian"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"2abuw":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"GmjzeUVYBvYmguE4","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unarmed-attacks/wave.webp","name":"Tail","level":0},"voxwb":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"a8J9vHxXHzapsvn5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/acid-splash.webp","name":"Secrete Musk","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wIebhbqdYwooA4IF":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ODlUp4DEvrFHExIc"}}}

Most Felsine learn farming, fishing, or similar supportive trades for their societies.</p>\n<p>There are those that choose another path however, find themselves seeking self betterment through study, skill, and might. These \"masters-away\" as they are sometimes known are often adventurers seeking to broaden and enhance their abilities but fill a very important role for their society, one that no Felsine wishes they must ever fulfill, but always must be ready. This responsibility is to protect their people in the case of some destructive event, whether this is natural disaster, invasion, or some other catastrophe. Felsine are socially conscious of the history they have moving from place to place as a people to survive danger and avoid supplication.</p>\n<h2>Alignment And Religion</h2>\n<p>Felsine alignments vary, but those close to their societies tend to lean towards lean toward neutral or good alignments. This dedication to their people builds a sense of community and support among each other. Many Felsine offer praise and offering to several gods, including Daikitsu, Erastil, and Cayden Cailean. However, they do not generally enter full worship of these deities, instead practicing a general reverence for spirits held in nature, objects, and even actions. This reverence has lead to many Felsine communities performing a form of god-calling and forming their own community deities.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Felsine have a wide variety of names, but most of them involve either some form of wordplay and/or include sounds they are able to produce more easily than most other ancestries such as purrs or meows. Given the well-traveled nature of the Felsine and the great deal of respect they hold for others, remnants of naming conventions from a great deal of cultures can be found peppered around Felsine communities.</p>\n<h2>Sample Names</h2>\n<p>Anya, Patches, Momo, Meowkle, Nyan, Ficher</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_felsine","humanoid"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-11-20T02:50:51.310-05:00","version":{"schema":0.669,"foundry":"0.8.9","system":"2.19.0.9009"}}},"hp":6,"size":"sm","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["cha"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["str"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"Nem"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["amurrun","dwarven","elven","gnomish","goblin","halfling"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GXEZnFwcNKsD0g4o":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Ancestries.mRzsEIHpSnaWh3VJ"}}}

The fact that they are so feared has only begrudged them the opportunities to mingle and come to understand other peoples and be understood themselves. Seemingly cruel to outsiders, this trait is more of a prankster-like quality in their eyes, as they themselves tend to find a thrill in being frightened. These qualities along with manipulation by outside powers, enslavement by other peoples or creatures who use them as shock troops, and vast cultural differences have stunted their ability to enter broader society. However, with the aid of chance, understanding, and fellows who realize their unseen plight, some bugbears have begun to live more peaceful lives, both within and without society as a whole.</em></p>\n<h3>You Might...</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek to vindicate not only yourself but others from the suspicions of others, particularly those tainted with preconception.</li>\n<li>Enjoy playing pranks and thrill-seeking.</li>\n<li>Prefer experiences to excessive belongings, but enjoy mementos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Others Probably...</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you prefer trophies over money or useful goods.</li>\n<li>Know little more than folktales about your people, few of which are in a good light.</li>\n<li>Feel physically intimidated by your physique.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Bugbears are broad-shouldered, tall, and muscular, sporting wide, tapered ears and large eyes. They are covered in short fur that ranges from sandy to black and grow longer hair from their heads and sometimes facial hair. Bugbears have thick and heavy bones, large canines, and wide mouths, much like their smaller goblin cousins. While they often stoop, causing them to seem a bit shorter, about the height of humans, when not doing so they commonly stand between 6 and a half feet and 7 feet tall. Bugbear's eyes are mostly one color even in the sclera with a large pupil, filled with a reflective film, and reflect light in a variety of colors. This color is most commonly a pale yellow, but reds, greens, and blues are not uncommon.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Bugbear society is broken across their people. An unfortunate situation brought about through the perpetuation of their widespread treatment. Those that break away, however, form their own ways of life relatively quickly. Many escape or are shown another way by goblins, who not long ago went through a similar paradigm shift. Some Bugbears insert themselves into other existing societies, leveraging a sort of stubborn endearment to show that they can not only be useful but also endearing and friendly. Others form their own communities, and regularly find reasons to celebrate, as nearly all bugbear societies enjoy in revelry and excitement. Bugbears have also adapted a version of the Night of the Pale as an evening of partying, tale-telling, and spook-making, a favorite pastime of many bugbears.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is no great measurement of bugbears as a whole, they differ from group to group, person to person, with seemingly only a common level of humor and love of entertainment. Several bugbears have begun to stir up various artistic communities, none more so than theater and music. They are enthusiastic, and perhaps their lack of preconceived notions of such artforms cause them to see things with truly fresh eyes and they will gleefully introduce completely new concepts, styles, and ideals.</p>\n<p>In \"the old life\" as many bugbears refer to it, they were considered cruel, beasts of terror, and sadistic. Many bugbears who have found new lives or have been born into better situations dislike this stereotype, citing training from both parent and oppressor. Somewhat related is their love of pranks, jokes, and being frightened. Most bugbears associate the feeling of fear with excitement.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Bugbears who have escaped the expected path of their people do not widely worship any deities, though some may find faith individually. Most bugbears place high importance on the self and tend to rely on personal feelings, though they are not necessarily selfish. This can be seen as innocuously through their desire to have fun and be entertained, though there are those who place themselves above all others and act as petty tyrants and bullies. Many unfettered bugbears have slight leanings toward chaotic alignments, while traditionally controlled and villanized bugbears tend toward evil, but bugbears are in no way naturally inclined to any given alignment.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Many bugbears spend a long time in search of their place in the world, some find that the journey itself is more the niche that fits them. Good pay and good friends can be found on the open road and amid the fearsome places of the world. Many find work with caravans as guards, or with entertainment troupes or shipping companies, spreading them far and wide across the lands.</p>\n<p>A not insignificant number of bugbears have sought to teach other bugbears that there is a better way of life than that of fear and war. Though this does not always end without bloodshed, the times that it does are a proud one for the adventuring bugbear.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Bugbear names vary quite a bit, as most vindicated bugbears pick for themselves new names and allow their children to select their own names once they learn to speak. It is not uncommon for a bugbear's name to change a few times over their lifetime. And while bugbears living \"the old life\" generally pick names that inspire fear, those outside of that tend to name themselves after things they like, important personal events, or in reference to people who are important to them. Some take short and simple names, while others might have long strings of names. They also tend to accept good-faith nicknames with as much seriousness as their taken names.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Gillsaved, Spook, Climber, Skycaller, Took, Bramblesneak, Kettle, Whistle, Sixfish</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_bugbear","goblin","humanoid"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-11-20T02:50:51.311-05:00","version":{"schema":0.669,"foundry":"0.8.9","system":"2.19.0.9009"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["str"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["dwarven","gnoll","gnomish","halfling","jotun","orcish"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"darkvision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GXEZnFwcNKsD0g4o":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Ancestries.o7cF2LtRiRsYfZyS"}}}
{"_id":"zG9y8vYI2mVQ1rmq","name":"Nashi","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/raccoon-head.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Known for their ingenuity and innovative approach to problem-solving, nashi are often a welcome sight in the eyes of most species. Whether master engineers or skilled spellcasters, nashi have cultivated a reputation for excellence that makes their goods welcome in nearly every port. They are a quick-thinking and hardy folk who value hard work and creativity, but they also have a reputation for overcomplicating simple matters and they're prone to wasting countless hours recreating the wheel if left unchecked.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nashi are short, stocky plantigrade humanoids whose body is covered in thick fur that often makes them appear stouter then they are. Although viewed as a disparaging remark by the nashi, the term \"raccoon folk\" does aptly summarize a typical nashi's appearance, as they possess furred bodies, long tails, mask-and-ring fur patterns, and nailed digits. Nashi fur patterns come in a variety of colors that resembles those of both raccoons and manguts, including shades of gray, black, brown, and tan. Nashi cannot grow hair on their heads aside from their fur coat, but often grow out and style the fur on their heads in ways not unlike those used by humans on their hair.</p>\n<p>Nashi have extremely sensitive hands and paws, a trait that is more pronounced when submerged in water. Nashi are capable of effortlessly distinguishing physical features and properties by touch, and are known to be able to accurately judge all manner of information regarding a creature's appearance save for color with nothing but a brief grazing of their fingertips. Their small bodies and dexterous fingers also make nashi adept at a number of tasks involving physical coordination and manipulation, but their true marvel is the size of their brains, which are slightly (but noticeably) larger in proportion to the rest of their bodies compared to many other humanoid species, including humans. This has led to a stereotype that all nashi are extraordinarily intelligent, and while they are certainly fast learners and quick thinkers they aren't so much so that they outshine other objectively intelligent species, such as elves or gnomes.</p>\n<h3>Life Cycle</h3>\n<p>Nashi children are born live after a gestation period of nine months, with twins being almost twice as common among nashi than most other humanoid species. At birth, newborn nashi are blind and deaf and while their tails have yet to develop their famous ringed patterns, all younglings possess their species' distinctive mask- shaped markings around their eyes from birth. A newborn nashi's ear canals after approximately three weeks following their birth, while their eyes open for the first time sometime during their second month of life. Nashi children develop physically and meet gross motor milestones at approximately the same rate as humans, albeit smaller. Young nashi are able to speak their first words around when they take their first steps, are usually capable of speaking simple sentences before their second birthday, and meet cognitive milestones at similarly accelerated rates when compared to young members of other species.</p>\n<p>Whereas other species have symbolic milestones, such as rites of passage, young nashi have very concrete milestones in the form of their darkly colored tail rings. Newborn nashi begin life with uniformly colored tails, typically in lighter tones, but as they age their famous rings develop naturally. Most nashi develop a total of four or five tail rings throughout their lifetime, with one tail ring appearing during toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, and finally one or two during young adulthood. While it's largely coincidental that nashi tail rings tend to develop around major developmental milestones like first steps, first day of school, and others, that hasn't stopped nashi culture from developing an entire culture of symbolism around their appearances and what they mean for the child's personality and future. Some nashi even claim to be oracles able to divine an individual's future by the their tail rings, but most of these individuals are viewed as con artists trying to make a quick coin.</p>\n<p>Nashi are physically mature after approximately 18 years, after which they age at the same rate as humans, living an average of 100 years. Nashi have proportionately more asexual members of their species than humans do, but this has little bearing on the species' overall population due to the high frequency of twin births among nashi.</p>\n<h2>If You're a Nashi, You Likely...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer to work with your hands, especially when it involves crafting things.</li>\n<li>Are prone to bouts of energetic excitement.</li>\n<li>Value hard work and believe that one's value as an individual is the sum of their skills and successes.</li>\n<li>Enjoy spending time practicing and refining your skills and usually have an personal hobby.</li>\n<li>Can quickly and accurately recall information.</li>\n<li>Know a great deal about a specific field of study, but have also accrued a great deal of general knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are patronizing towards you and don't respect your personal space.</li>\n<li>Suspect that you use big words or complex sentences to mock them or are otherwise patronizing towards them.</li>\n<li>Expect you to be absent-minded.</li>\n<li>Believe that you like being petted and fawned over, and blame you for their behavior when you correct them.</li>\n<li>Assume that you're a mad scientist or a genius inventor who can solve any problem with grit and elbow grease.</li>\n<li>Feel intimidated by your intellect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Physiology</h3>\n<p>Nashi are warm-blooded creatures who stand 3 feet tall and weigh a surprising 75 pounds on average. Compared to other similarly sized humanoids, nashi are surprisingly heavy, as their bones are denser to compensate for the surprising amount of muscle and girth that a typical nashi has. Their fur and tails likewise contribute to their weight, and although a nashi's tail isn't as proportionately long as a kitsune's or a mephian's, it comprises approximately 20% of the nashi's weight on its own. Nashi have beady eyes whose irises are often hidden behind their eyelids, making their eyes look completely black unless they open their eyes especially wide or are looking off to the side. They have plantigrade feet and black, stubby nails at the end of each of their fingers and toes, as well as leathery skin on the bottoms of their hands and feet covered with sensitive hairs. These hairs afford the nashi their famously accurate sense of touch and make their hands and feet so sensitive that nashi culture considers hand and foot massage to be a form of sensual massage.</p>\n<p>Nashi have slightly sharper senses of smell and taste than an average human, and their sense of touch is significantly more acute, especially on their palms and the bottom of their feet. Nashi are able to canvas an extremely detailed mental picture of the ground simply by walking over it with their bare feet, and can accurately identify most stimuli that are in direct contact with their hands by size, weight, and shape using only their sense of touch. In addition to being more precise than a human's sense of touch, a nashi's sense of touch can accurately detect stimuli as small as a single grain of pollen. As a result nashi are extremely insistent about proper hygiene, as they can sense irritants on their hands and feet that most humans wouldn't have even known existed, let alone were present on their bodies.</p>\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n<p>Nashi culture emphasizes personal agency, creativity, and hard work, and most nashi strive to include all three of these tenants in everything they do. Nashi society often places strenuous pressure on its individuals to build a lasting legacy for themselves before they die, and these demands tend to become more and more exuberant with each passing generation, as nashi society tends to look down on those who can't surpass the accomplishments of their forbearers. As a result, those who partake in nashi culture often seem frantic and constantly stressed for success.</p>\n<h3>Life</h3>\n<p>Curiosity defines nashi from the moment they open their eyes for the first time, and that same curiosity is a driving force throughout their lives. Compared to other species, nashi enroll their children in school at a young age and their curriculums focused on giving the youngling the skills they need to answer life's questions for themselves rather than rote memorization. Nashi are encouraged to dabble in a variety of topics in youth until they find a field that calls to them, be it mathematics or martial arts. Shortly after their 10th birthday, young nashi formally choose their area of study at a large social gathering known as a Celebration of Calling. Once decided, these young nashi are expected to seek out part-time apprenticeships and focus their schooling on topics related to their chosen field. While it isn't impossible for nashi to change their calling once they've formally announced it, changing one's calling is something of a social stigma among nashi and stereotypes the individual as being flaky or unable to sound judgments regarding their personal skills and expertise.</p>\n<p>While nashi have family units, they tend to be less pronounced than those of other species. While nashi families love and support one another, their culture is one of fierce independence and stiff competition and those less than ideal traits sometimes rear their ugly heads in family life too. Nashi meritocracy encourages individuals to vie for social status at any cost, and this unfortunately includes family. It is depressingly common for otherwise loving nashi families to tear themselves apart over matters of business and personal legacy should multiple family members engage in similar professions independently, so many nashi logically choose fields of study that overlap very little with those of their family members to avoid rivalry and infighting. When nashi families do focus on a shared field of study, they often do so by banding together into a literal family business or research unit with the head of the family acting as lead. While this often negates any chance of the family imploding under its own quest for social status, families that work together in this capacity often struggle to keep their work separate from their home life, which is a major reason that so many nashi prefer to walk separate paths from their families in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>Nashi architecture is ornate and intricate in appearance, often featuring a dazzling combination of metal and glass supplemented by sturdy stone foundations covered with glazed clay mosiacs. Distinctive archways cradle door frames and stained glass windows, which are typically arranged in fanciful patterns, and both interior and exterior walls are often painted in bright, striking color combinations. Nashi architects are famous for building using a variety of geographic shapes with plenty of angles in their room design; and hexagonal towers with bell-shaped or conical roofs are staples of their style. Nashi often construct their buildings with ceilings that are high by human standards, and every building is expected to have at least one resource center stocked with dozens of books and whatever reference materials that the building's owner can afford. Most buildings are outfitted with accommodations for the latest feats of nashi engineering, and renovations to make accommodations for the latest mechanical trend is commonplace among nashi with the means to do so.</p>\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\n<p>Nashi clothing appears incredibly piecemeal in terms of style and stitch work, and in most cases such eventually are accurate. As a race of innovators motivated almost entirely by the discovery of the \"next, greatest thing\", nashi fashion goes through fads not from season by season, but week to week, and fads consist of anything from colors and patterns to fundamental styles of stitch work and clothing type. Because fashion changes so quickly in nashi society, only the wealthiest nashi can truly afford to stay up to date on the latest styles and trends while the rest are left with dozens of garments that simply don't match should they try to keep up. As a result, many nashi end up trying to find specific garments that they find comfortable and pleasing, working to create individual outfits from whatever parts they happen across and combining disparate elements into an aesthetic whole. Of course, should such a style become trendy as often is the case, the parts of that piecemeal outfits could lead to the next baffling nashi fashion trend.</p>\n<h3>Communities &amp; Nations</h3>\n<p>To outsiders, nashi society is often seen as rushed and volatile due to its constituents' obsession with unrelenting progress. A meritocracy at its core, nashi strive to advance and perfect everything from technology to policy to social justice, and while this often proves a blessing to those seeking freedom from oppression or creative freedom, a distinct lack of conservative voices challenging nashi progressivism on whether proposed innovations are necessary or practical occasionally causes nashi progressives to circle backwards on policy, especially regarding issues like taxation, immigration, and foreign policy. While nashi governments are fairly persistent, individual regimes collapse regularly, with the past four generations experiencing an average of 100 government shut downs and 32 collapses during their lifetime due to overspending and political quagmires. Nashi meritocracy is similarly susceptible to political strongmen who successfully convince the public that their brand of tyranny is the most pragmatic path for the community, and their society often sees at least one such tyrant every generation or so. Recently nashi leaders have begun incorporating a council of members of other species into their cabinets as advisors, and data suggests that governments who have made this switch have record-low tumultuousness spanning decades, but fascism remains an ever-constant threat for their political future.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Nashi possess their own, unique language called Nashi that has its roots in Sylvan. While Nashi as a spoken language isn't particularly noteworthy among languages, as a written language Nashi is reportedly the easiest language to learn to read and write, to the extent that its inventor once boasted that even an orc could learn the language in the span of 10 days. This is due to its intuitive design-in Nashi, syllables are written in a way that indicates how each sound is produced. Nashi names tend to be strange, neigh unpredictable combinations of traditional Nashi words and words from other languages, particularly Common.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Nashi cuisine reflects its culture's insistence upon innovation as opposed to invention, blending the culinary styles of dozens of different species and their ethnic groups into fusion distinctly their own. As a result, nashi communities tend to have dramatically different cooking styles from one another, as each community's cooking is informed by neighboring species. If nashi food has one defining feature, its that many of the foodstuffs that nashi use in their cooking are developed using food processing techniques that they've innovated and engineered using numerous techniques, with some dishes becoming completely lost to time as the machines once used to create them fall into obsolescence. Much as how nashi clothing styles fall into and out of fashion at a rapid pace, so too do various cooking styles and dishes. One particular dish that has persisted for nearly a century despite this is ringtail pie, a dish similar to shepherd's pie save that five different \"rings\" of meats and vegetables are arranged like rings on a tree from the pie's center to its exterior, making every bite a delightful surprise.</p>\n<h3>Relations With Others</h3>\n<p>Although they get along well with members of most other races, nashi tend to internalize erroneous conclusions about other cultures and species based on information gained from first- or even second-hand contact. This tendency is of no insult among nashi, as they hold little qualm about revising previously held facts with new information. This often isn't true for members of other species, however, and as a result nashi are prone to accidentally offending others through incorrectly drawn conclusions regarding others that range from simple mistakes to offensive slights or bizarre claims. As a result, nashi tend to get along poorly with people who offend easily.</p>\n<h3>Trade</h3>\n<p>Although nashi society boasts more scientific researchers and applied scientists than any other species' society, the majority of their population occupies more traditional trades such as carpentry and metallurgy. Whatever field they choose to enter, nashi are famous for using state of the art technologies in their field. Sometimes these innovations prove a boon and result in highly valued products. For example, nashi carpenters are noteworthy for their ergonomic designs that make many of their furniture more comfortable compared to those of other species. In other cases, nashi innovation seems different for the sake of being different. For example, nashi blacksmithes often practice their trade using electrically-charged furnaces, but since these devices don't melt or set metal any quicker than a traditional forge they're largely considered a novelty by other crafters.</p>\n<h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>\n<p>Several notable ethnic groups exist among nashi, as noted below.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Culo:</strong> Sometimes called monochrome nashi because they predominately have fur coats in shades of gray and black, culo nashi are an adaptive people that make their home all across the world. Where other nashi ethnic groups have firmly rooted cultural identities and traditions, culo nashi tend to blend in with the cultures of their neighbors, often going out of their way to bring members of other species into their settlements in order to study their culture, traditions, and technologies, adapting what they like and discarding what they don't.</li>\n<li><strong>Syanni:</strong> Compared to the muted, earthy tones of other nashi, the bright reds and oranges of a syanni nashi's fur stands in stark contrast to that of other nashi. Preferring to live away from large urban centers in quiet, rural areas, other nashi unfairly stereotype syanni as bumpkins for choosing to abstain from other ethnic group's work-centric values, instead valuing self-care and personal fulfillment.</li>\n<li><strong>Tanukun:</strong> Possessing fur coats peppered in shades of brown, fulvous, and gray, tanukun nashi are named after tanuki, a type of magical shapeshifter. According to legend, the tanukun nashi descend from a nashi hero who saved a dying tanuki and nursed them back to health. As payment, the tanuki swore to protect the hero and their family. In doing so, the hero and their family developed physical features resembling those of tanuki, such as speckled fur in shades of brown, fulvous, and brown.</li>\n<li><strong>Zumei:</strong> Known for their seafaring culture, the zumei are best known for the sharp band of black fur that encircles their necks and for fur coats, which are flecked with golden yellow fur that culminates in a predominately golden yellow tail. Zumei culture places high importance on the sea and its bounty, and many zumei are skilled sailors for fish or transport goods for a living. Their engineers focus on improving sailing technology, making it faster and safer however possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2>Origins</h2>\n<p>Nashi origin myths are somewhat uninspired when compared to those of other species, as they are far more interested in societal advancement than mythology and seeing as no culture's origin mythology has ever been confirmed or denied by the gods, they consider such tales to be a waste of time.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_nashi"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.692,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-11-20T02:50:51.313-05:00","version":{"schema":0.665,"foundry":"0.8.9","system":"2.19.0.9009"}}},"hp":8,"size":"sm","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["int"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"Nashi"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"2uwix":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"m0TD9X8tR9GEl3bo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/earthquake.webp","name":"Precise Touch","level":1}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Ancestries.zG9y8vYI2mVQ1rmq"}}}
