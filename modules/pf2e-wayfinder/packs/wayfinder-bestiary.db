While he considers many in the town as little more than parts for future projects, several residents have wormed their way into his ill-tempered graces. This care frequently comes across through scolding and haranguing; more than one resident can recall Lutarn berating them for wasting their, &ldquo;youth, health, and all-too-mortal lives,&rdquo; on frivolous pursuits. For those able to weather his acerbic tongue and gain the respect of the dhampir however, Lutarn ensures that they receive the best care he can provide (the petty corruption of preferential treatment not uncommon in a provincial town like Grayce).

On one side, he has never had greater access to supplies to expand his inventory, nor more leeway in how he pursues his work. His research has progressed by leaps and bounds and any occasional lapses in concealing his activity have a ready-made scapegoat in the ancient lich and his followers. On the other hand, Lutarn merely wishes to pursue his research in peace and secrecy, and the increased scrutiny from nosy crusaders adds risk to his every action. Nor is Lutarn eager to see Tar-Baphon succeed in his machinations.

They appear as a massive ball of arms, all connected at the shoulder. Flensclaws mindlessly claw, roll, and scuttle their way throughout the forbidding lands of the Sarkoris Scar, forever seeking their next battle. They first appeared several months after the closing of the Worldwound, and since then, their numbers have increased dramatically.</p>\n<p>Adventurers traveling to the Sarkoris Scar have noted that the flensclaws' roamings are far from random. Though mindless, these creatures seem to be searching for something, as though programmed or commanded to find it. Even more horrifying, the creatures are known to attack groups of travelers, only to take their victims' arms before stealing away into the night. Crusaders and returning Sarkorins have increasingly found armless bodies littering the wilds along the Sarkora and West Sarkora Rivers, particularly around the city of Undarin. Some believe that the creatures are able to add the arms to their bodies, creating ever-growing creatures. Others believe that they use the arms for a more terrifying purpose.</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>Flensclaws are most often encountered individually, fearlessly relying on their multitude of arms to attack several opponents at once. Occasionally, these creatures gather in small groups called masses, where they attack much larger groups.</p>\n<h3>Treasure</h3>\n<p>Those who defeat a flensclaw must sift through a gory display, but it is often worth the effort. Since the arms were crafted from crusaders and demons, many still bear magic rings, bracers, and armbands. Stories from the Sarkoris Scar tell of adventurers finding items such as bracers of armor, rings of energy resistance, and gloves of storing among the masses of arms.</p>\n<h3>Variant Flensclaws</h3>\n<p>While most flensclaws are constructed from humanoid and demon arms, other kinds have been rumored. Giant variants have also been seen near the High Cairns. These creatures are huge, elite, have a 15-foot reach, and are immune to cold. Legends also speak of an undead variant composed of human zombie arms. These creatures have the undead trait instead of the construct trait.

Appearing as a wolf with its head and forequarters covered in inky black feathers, a ravenwolf's feathered front limbs end in long, black talons. The creature's jaws combine aspects of a wolf's jaws and a raven's beak. The ink-black feathered wings usually stay folded on the creature's back, mostly concealed until unfurled just before flight. Yet those who have seen a ravenwolf and lived to tell the tale say the beast's unsettling black eyes are its most memorable detail, for they contain the dark glint of an intellect far beyond that of a simple beast.</p>\n<p>Ravenwolves are believed to have been spawned by Baba Yaga herself, desirous of creating her own chimeric beast. Whether they escaped the witch's control or were set free by her whim is unknown, but they have since spread across northern Avisatn. They are rarely seen except by their prey but are known to hunt the dark northern forests and the tundra surrounding the Crown of the World. They have remained secluded in the Saga Lands until recently, when the invasion of Southmoor forced them out of hiding and into conflict with other creatures.</p>\n<p>Ravenwolves are pack hunters. The alpha female will take flight to spot prey, then howl to draw the rest of the pack.

Shortly after the closing of the Worldwound, he sensed that the balance of power was beginning to shift, with some of the Mendevian Crusaders moving to Kyonin to help the fight against him. To combat this, Treerazer summoned a horde of babau to his side and bound them to the willow trees around the swamp, creating a hybrid of fiend and tree. The blood of the babau burst into flame and infused the willow trees with magical fire, leaving them in a constant state of pain from the persistent, internal burning. The willow fiends can combat this burning by soaking in water, though soaking their roots in blood lessens the pain considerably more than water. However, the pain always returns.</p>\n<p>These new creations are as intelligent as their forebears, sharing a liking for assassinations and striking from the shadows. They delight in using their seemingly innocent forms to approach their quarry unnoticed. Since creating the willow fiends, Treerazer has used them sparingly, trying to conserve the secret of their existence until such a time that they can make a deadly impact. A few have been sent out as assassins, taking out key figures and making it look like accidents, such as buildings collapsing or fires erupting.</p>\n<p>While Treerazer values his creations as key pawns, the rest of his demonic followers look down upon them, feeling the willow fiends are no longer \"true\" demons now that they have been corrupted by the \"purity\" of nature. This criticism and the willow fiends' own constant, fiery pain drive them to slaughter excessively to prove themselves and to lessen their pain. Treerazer frequently must contain and hide their slaughter to ensure they aren't revealed to the world at large until it is time.</p>\n<p>When they are not engaging in bloodshed, willow fiends spend their time in the shallow parts of the swamp, soaking their leaves and branches. These long soaks cause a hissing from the swamp around them, as the waters turn to steam.</p>\n<p>There are those within Kyonin who have picked up on the first hints of the fiends' existence, wondering about the steam and mist that now surrounds Tanglebriar on a near-constant basis.

What's hard is keeping that position. Bunbog Bigbone, chieftain of the Gutguzzler tribe, does so through excessive use of force and taking all the food he can swallow. As a devout worshiper of Venkelvore, Bunbog takes pleasure in two acts sacred to the faith: eating and torture. When he makes an example by eating dissenting goblins alive, the two practices combine in a way he finds truly spiritual. When there aren't any goblins brave enough to speak out, he takes half of all food collected on raids to eat during the evening's celebratory feast, an occurrence that happens at least twice a week. And when there's nothing to eat, he practices stabbing goblins that he imagines looked at him funny in the eyes with his magical spear.</p>\n<p>Despite being members of a tribe known as Gutguzzler, all its goblins have been starving and lean since Bunbog took command. This has made them as voraciously hungry as their leader, out of necessity rather than self-indulgence. Gutguzzler's daughter, Probina, is the singular exception. She has been his pride and joy from the day she left the whelping cage, and is the only other well-fed goblin in the tribe-though not nearly as well-fed as her father. What's been troubling Bunbog as of late, however, is Probina's repeated insistence that maybe raids on longshanks territory should stop, and he should share at least some of the food he hoards with the rest of the tribe. He (correctly) blames the nomad Zerr'ul for filling her head with such ideas, though he does not suspect that they are a barghest. Zerr'ul has only been in Gutguzzler territory for a few weeks, but conflict seems like it will come to a head soon, dividing the tribe in two, between those fearful of their chieftain and those willing to take a chance on a better future.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"sm"},"ci":[]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-07T19:31:19.190-04:00","version":{"schema":0.692,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":4},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":3},"cha":{"mod":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":8,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":12,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Chieftan Bunbog Bigbone","actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/pf2e-wayfinder/art/WoW_Zeitgob_ChiefBigbone.webp","light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"24rkYpWMJJS1ryZS","name":"Darkvision","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only.

One such practice is the use of their own bodies as magical materials and reagents. While many spellcasters use their blood to aid in crafting homunculi; particularly ambitious, desperate, or accident-prone necromancers have perfected rituals to use their own lost organs to create tiny servant golems called canopians.</p>\n<p>To create a canopian, a necromancer puts their preserved organ into a special vessel made to house it. They create this vessel by first mixing their own blood into fresh clay and forming it into a pot or jar. Before firing the clay, they wrap the focus in enchanted bandages and place it inside the vessel. The firing process completes the ritual and if successful, the new canopian walks out of the kiln on its own to find its creator.</p>\n<p>Most canopians hold only small parts of their progenitors, pieces just large enough to bind the lifeforce to the vessel, such as a few teeth or a lost finger. These canopians are only capable of performing basic tasks, but their simple composition makes them easy to create in large numbers. Foci fashioned from greater amounts of flesh and organs create stronger, sturdier canopians while foci created using more complex organs might bestow additional abilities, such as an eyeball granting improved senses. Necromancers who create numerous canopians might etch runes or shape the clay of the canopic vessel to depict the organ used as a focus, or which task the canopian is designed to perform.</p>\n<p>If a canopian's progenitor lives on after death as an undead, as many necromancers do, the canopian continues to serve its master as long as their new form has some corporeal connection to their former life. A canopian becomes free of control if its progenitor dies without reanimating, if they become an incorporeal undead, or if they are a corporeal undead and are destroyed. In these cases, a canopian typically searches for a new master with a similar biological make-up to serve. It gravitates to blood relatives if any are near, though any creature of the same race or ancestry can find themselves the unwitting master of a wayward canopian.

More than a few fiends wandered the area, some having fled from the Worldwound, others having been summoned and broken free from their masters, and still others that had escaped in myriad ways from the infernal planes.</p>\n<p>The list of fiendish creatures in the area included swarms of hellwasps. While many of them roamed free, tormenting living creatures, several happened to be inhabiting corpses when the Whispering Tyrant's necromantic energies rippled across the land. As the dark energy animated the bodies the fiendish creatures were already manipulating, a strange interaction took place. The energies mutated the affected hellwasp swarms and, while they did not become undead, they gained a strange, voracious appetite for undead creatures and numerous tools to help them hunt their new favored prey. While they lost their ability to inhabit corpses, this seemed a fair trade given their new abilities. Invariably, the swarms' first victims were the undead bodies they inhabited when the transformation took place.</p>\n<p>Given the abundant prey in the area and the lack of predators able to deal with these new creatures-dubbed soul seekers- it is little wonder that these hellwasp offshoots experienced a population explosion. Now these creatures and their offspring haunt the Eye of Dread as an ever-growing terror for the undead horrors that wander the region.</p>\n<p>As with their hellwasp ancestors, an individual soul seeker has no more intelligence than any ordinary insect, but when they congregate in large numbers they form a surprisingly complex, if alien, intellect. Also like their hellwasp ancestors, they are able to communicate using their buzzing to reproduce languages they know. It is not uncommon to find these cruel predators using this ability to taunt their prey, even mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies incapable of understanding them.</p>\n<p>With their fiendish intellect, they can easily trap and outmaneuver mindless undead and even outsmart many of those that retain their sentience. Soul seekers are particularly terrifying predators for ghosts as the soul seekers find it easy to devour restless spirits bound to a single location and return to the spot where they manifest every few days to devour them every time they reappear.</p>\n<p>A few enterprising but shortsighted individuals and groups have set up partnerships with soul seeker swarms, attempting to harness their predilection for destroying undead in the Eye of Dread. Some have even exported the creatures to other areas to clear crypts and tombs of undead guardians. These partnerships never last long, for while soul seekers prefer necromantic energy to feed upon, they still enjoy tormenting and devouring living beings as well, turning on their allies as soon as it becomes convenient for them or they grow bored waiting for their favored prey.</p>\n<p>An individual soul seeker looks like an ordinary wasp but with a mottled white and gray carapace and eyes that glow with a sickly green light.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"greater darkvision, undead sense (imprecise) 60 feet"},"traits":{"value":["devil","fiend","swarm"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["infernal","necril"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["fire","precision","swarm-mind"],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"physical","label":"Physical","value":"7","exceptions":"except silver"},{"type":"poison","label":"Poison","value":"10","exceptions":""}],"dv":[{"type":"area-damage","label":"Area Damage","value":"5"},{"type":"good","label":"Good","value":"5"},{"type":"splash-damage","label":"Splash Damage","value":"5"}],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-07T19:31:19.264-04:00","version":{"schema":0.692,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":0},"dex":{"mod":0},"con":{"mod":0},"int":{"mod":0},"wis":{"mod":0},"cha":{"mod":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Soul Seeker Swarm","actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/pf2e-wayfinder/art/Bestiary_Soul%20Seeker%20Swarm_Final.webp","light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"m4szr0Ylt2Tc2ryH","name":"Greater Darkvision","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A creature with greater darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only.

They always possessed ambition, from when the Abyss whelped them to when a now-forgotten, inexperienced conjurer summoned them and gave them freedom over the hinterlands of Varisia. Zerr'ul had never been fond of the pangs of hunger, though they swore that mage would be their last meal. They wanted to be unique, and obtain a much more powerful form than the brutish mutants that simply ate their way to power. When Zerr'ul stumbled upon an incomplete occult ritual in another long-dead spellweaver's reclusive hideaway, they knew this was their opportunity. The ritual apparently gave its user the power to tap into the very zeitgeist of a given ancestry and derive paragon- like powers of intuition. Knowing that barghests bore an intrinsic connection to goblins, Zerr'ul began their task with vigor, eager to remove the hunger that had plagued them for so long and replace it with raw goblinoid might. Zerr'ul studied the ritual deeply, accounting for almost every variable. The only piece missing from their theory was how much goblins had changed in the last few decades.</p>\n<p>Lastwall's people owed their lives to the Crookedtoe tribe. The nation of Oprak was attempting diplomatic relations with other humanoids. Isger's tribes had begun to heal their deep scars from the Goblinblood Wars, and reached out to established settlements to provide and receive aid. The goblinoid people were changing as a whole for the better, and this had a profound effect on the ritual.</p>\n<p>When Zerr'ul completed their work, they realized that their fur had turned white, their hunger was gone, and, most curiously of all, their ambition had ceased. Zerr'ul had found their first steps of redemption through tapping into the collective psyche of goblins - and as a result, their connection to Basalfeyst was cut off. Curious at this, they began to explore Varisia in their new albino goblin form. While their grasp of goodness is still tenuous, they spread word of the change that all goblins can undergo to various tribes, and have met with some success in converting tribes towards diplomatic relations. Their current project is integrating and redeeming the Gutguzzler tribe, and the chieftain's daughter in particular has an interest in Zerr'ul's teachings.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["fiend","goblin"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["abyssal","common","goblin"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[{"type":"physical","label":"Physical","value":"5","exceptions":"except magical"}],"dv":[],"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-07T19:31:19.290-04:00","version":{"schema":0.692,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":3},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""}},"customModifiers":{}},"token":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Zerr'ul","actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/pf2e-wayfinder/art/WoW_Zeitgob_ZerrulBarghest.webp","light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"7vELUebAqQaOBMdp","name":"Darkvision","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only.

He toiled in the shadow of family only as long as it took for him to acquire enough resources to strike out. At 36, a mere child by dwarven standards, he joined a trade expedition going to Kaer Maga that set the stage for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>After an uneventful trek across Druma, the caravan boarded a ship to cross Lake Encarthan. Not long after, a storm wrecked the vessel and cast the crew and passengers into turbulent waters. Many survivors washed up on the Isle of Terror, including Barnabas. A series of desperate escapes and constant danger followed as the castaways tried to find a way off the island. After six long days, with only himself and two others remaining, Barnabas stole a ship from a band of pirates who had come ashore to hide their ill-gotten treasure.</p>\n<p>This brush with death only whetted Barnabas' appetite for adventure. Funded by the stolen pirate treasure, he re-equipped and joined a band of mercenaries headed to the River Kingdoms. In the years that followed, he traveled throughout the Lake Encarthan region. Not every venture was a success, but still, somehow, the dwarf always found a way to profit. Over time he developed a reputation and a considerable set of skills garnered from raiding ruins and confronting monsters.</p>\n<p>Now well into his 90s, Barnabas is renowned, having led expeditions funded by the Blakros museum, the University of Lepidstadt, and many others. His latest venture, a dig in the Echo Woods, has produced numerous Azlanti relics, but Barnabas already has an eye out for the next great opportunity.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["dwarf","humanoid"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["azlanti","common","draconic","dwarven","jotun","undercommon"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"rarity":"unique","size":{"value":"med"},"ci":[]},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-08-07T19:31:19.343-04:00","version":{"schema":0.692,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.13.5.16"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":2},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":5},"int":{"mod":4},"wis":{"mod":2},"cha":{"mod":5}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":11,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"name":"Barnabas Ironeye","actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true}},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/pf2e-wayfinder/art/WoW_Interested%20Parties_Barnabas%20Ironeye.webp","light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"FnCrp5DMIIUMgJ8S","name":"Darkvision","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only.

Her face is dominated by two overlarge eyes, with a smaller set of eyes on her forehead, and her skin has a waxy sheen. Her coloration fades from a venomous yellow to a matte black on her hands and feet, and long greasy hair trails down her back. A patchwork collection of rags primarily serves as her outfit, the exception being a golden symbol of Mazmezz dangling from a chain around her neck. Her fingers end in talons, and a bow is strapped to her back.</p>\n<p>Born in the ravaged lands of the Worldwound, Uttu was just one of many children in her cult to be &lsquo;blessed' by Mazmezz. Offered deference by the non-tainted members of the cult, she and her siblings were kept in as close to luxury as the cult could achieve. Raised to worship the demon, they took to the cult to varying degrees, with few matching the fervor that Uttu demonstrated. Before long, her devotion was rewarded, as the young tiefling was blessed with a small measure of the Creeping Queen's power.</p>\n<p>Her star on the rise, Uttu lead the cult and various demonic vermin in several successful raids against crusader bands, capturing sacrifices for Mazmezz and expanding the cult's territory. All that came crashing to an end when the Worldwound was closed. Suddenly cut off from the support of their patron demon and facing increasing numbers of crusaders and Sarkorian reclaimers, times grew desperate until one night Uttu had a vision. In her dream a creature composed of legs, eyes, and fangs was confronted again and again by a blinding light. Retreating, it crawled into a shadow and spun a cocoon. Encased in thread, it changed quickly, ripping its way free and spreading tenebrous wings.

Fleeing the predations of adaros, sea devils, and krakens common to the region, many melacors have recently migrated to the coasts of Mediogalti Island and the Shackles, and into the flooded swamps of the Sodden Lands. Melacors are calm and friendly creatures but are accustomed to defending themselves against terrifying dangers. They approach their new surroundings and neighbors with caution, unsure which of the many humanoids and creatures they come across will prove peaceful, and which will attempt to consume them.</p>\n<p>Resembling long, hairless, yellow otters with cat-like features and six, short, stubby paws, melacors are incredibly graceful swimmers-though their bodies are too heavy for their webbed paws to support on land. Though their eyes are small and their vision poor, melacors possess a mane of coral-like protrusions and growths around their necks. These coral manes detect sound with precision, enabling them to 'see' great distances with echolocation. The growths also conduct electricity. Each melacor's coral mane grows in unique shapes, colors, and patterns. Melacors take great pride in their manes and are greatly saddened when a piece is damaged or broken off.</p>\n<p>On the open ocean, melacors live in packs of up to twenty-six. Along the coasts and in shallow waters however, they break into smaller packs out of necessity, and rarely travel in groups larger than four. They communicate with their kin by singing in Aquan, which travels well beneath the waves. Although many melacors have emigrated to shallow waters, they are happiest in the wide-open ocean, a hundred feet below the surface. They enjoy dancing, and regularly create and perform complicated feats of aquatic choreography with their kin for fun. When multiple packs gather in one location, they host dance competitions, with the winning packs earning first choice of food and territory.</p>\n<p>Melacors eat fish, crustaceans, and clams, but their favorite food is electric eels, which they find tickle their mouths. Melacors in the Sodden Lands have recently taken a liking to shocker lizards for much the same reason-a culinary preference driving them into conflict with the boggards and iruxi that sometimes raise the shocker lizards as pets.</p>\n<p>When a melacor is in danger, its kin rush in to protect it. Although they prefer to flee if able, melacors refuse to leave even a single packmate behind, and fight ferociously to defend each other.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"aquatic

A series of spikes runs horizontally along their sides. Their backs are flat and shift little as the seizarks move, which made them perfect war beasts for the ancient Thassilonians. The wizards mounted platforms and howdahs upon the creatures' backs. From there, these wizards rode or cast spells in comfort. To protect their massive steeds, the Runelords and their servitors enchanted the seizarks, giving them powerful magical defenses. This magical energy soon seeped into their very being, causing many seizarks to pass on innate magical defenses to their young. Their spikes siphon magical energy and transform it into electricity, which they can shoot from their mouths or transmit through their spikes.</p>\n<p>Seizarks travel alone or in pairs, abandoning their eggs where they are laid and leaving their infants to fend for themselves. They are voracious predators unused to their surroundings and still finding their place in the food chain. This has led many seizarks to consume everything in sight- including taking bites from inanimate objects like boats, houses, and rocks-to test their surroundings and assert their dominance.</p>\n<p>Seizarks are territorial and aggressive. Although they once battled each other to the death over land, food, and mates, centuries under the control of the Runelords has led to behavioral changes-at least regarding one another. Now seizarks settle territory disputes with others through spike displays, roaring, and other nonviolent displays of dominance. Seizarks only fight other seizarks when forced to by a humanoid master.</p>\n<p>In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, seizarks have been spotted terrorizing seaside farms and villages, eating livestock and villagers alike. In the Steaming Sea, they capsize boats and consume the contents. In New Thassilon, Runelord Belimarius has dispatched war wizards to capture and regain control of the seizarks, which she considers her personal property.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, magic sense (imprecise) 60
