The waystation is a wooden cabin covered in graying, cracked shingles, and the windows are all shuttered with thick, weathered shutters of a simple but functional make.

On a critical success, the PCs deduce that the creatures that pulled the wagon were not horses but more likely some kind of giant insect or arthropod.</p>\n<p>Although Barnabas is eager to recover his wagon, he also needs food, rest, and a chance to warm up, and so he presses the PCs to investigate the waystion before following the wagon.</p>\n<p>Forewarned by Uttu's @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9GkOWDFDEMuV3hJr]{Familiar's Face} spell, the cultists have prepared the waystation for defense.

Forewarned, she and her cultists prepare for the heroes to come to the waystation.</p>\n<p>Anyone who succeeded on the check to learn more about Barnabas, or spoke to Durant about him, recognizes the dwarf as the one who hired them for this task. Wounded and poisoned, Barnabas does not awaken without treatment, but his tracks can be followed back to the waystation if the heroes are unable to heal him. He is suffering from the wounded condition, as well as giant scorpion venom and an arcanotoxin called the crawling queen's kiss, created by Uttu from the blood of demons. Both the scorpion venom and wounded condition can be treated by Medicine checks or appropriate magic (<span data-pf2-check=\"medicine\" data-pf2-traits=\"action:treat-wounds\" data-pf2-label=\"Treat Wounded DC\" data-pf2-dc=\"15\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"gm\">Medicine</span> for wounded, <span data-pf2-check=\"medicine\" data-pf2-traits=\"action:treat-poison\" data-pf2-label=\"Treat Poison DC\" data-pf2-dc=\"18\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"gm\">Medicine</span> for the poison), but the crawling queen's kiss requires a special antidote (which Uttu has) or a neutralize poison from a caster of at least 10th level. Success at either previous Medicine checks also reveals the arcanotoxin, as well as the knowledge that without an antidote Barnabas will die in the next 12 to 24 hours.</p>\n<p>If the heroes heal Barnabas, he awakens enough to relay the following, though he is still in clearly bad, and worsening, condition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"My thanks... That monstrosity nearly had me. *Cough* I don't recognize you, but you have my gratitude. I don't suppose you might be the group hired from Absalom? Coming to meet Barnabas Ironeye, Honorary Professor of Antiquities at the University of Lepidstadt? Heh *cough, cough* Not that the titles will matter much longer in my state. Listen, I'll make you the offer I made then. 150 gold each if you can get me and my cargo back to Absalom safely. *cough*\"</p>\n<p>\"I was *cough, cough* attacked by some kind of cultists at the way station.

If she lied I'm done for, but if she does have an antidote, that might be my only chance.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Barnabas is struggling, but answers questions as well as he can. He didn't get an accurate count of the cultists but knows there are more than two. All he knows about Uttu is that she is some kind of fiend-blooded spell caster with an affinity for insectile vermin. Barnabas has to return to Absalom alive and healthy enough to get the cargo to his backers in order for the heroes to collect their payment, a fact he will communicate if it seems needed.

Realizing the storm was coming, and having watched the party fight her animal companion via her spell, she retreated here with the rest of her vermin allies to defend the stolen wagon in case her cultists proved unable to finish them off. Now she lies in wait on the upper story, while her scorpions guard the lower floor. The party will have some cover from Uttu due to the limitations of line-of-sight through the loft opening to the second floor.</p>\n<p>The barn is old and run down, creaking in the storm, but stable enough to withstand the wind. Water streams in through multiple holes in the roof, leaving the entire place soggy. For the duration of the storm nothing in the barn can be lit on fire for more than a round, and the structure itself cannot be ignited at all. Ceilings in the barn are 8 feet up, with the center of the barn above the second floor reaching 15 feet up. The main barn door stands open wide enough to accommodate the wagon, having never been closed after it was brought here, and the wind throws waves of rain through the opening. The storm is bad enough now that ambient lighting is dim, and Uttu has forgone any light sources in the barn as neither she nor her allies need it.

With 150 gold each in their hands he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You're capable adventurers, there's no doubt of that. I've got need of folks with skills like yours, if you ever find you are looking for employ. If not, perhaps I can help in some other fashion, connecting you to the right buyer for certain items or such. You've done me a great service, and Barnabas Ironeye never forgets a favor owed!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that he shakes the hands of everyone willing and departs for a healer, still recovering from his ordeal.</p>\n<p>The heroes may call upon Barnabas at a later date, reaching him through Durant if he should be out of Absalom at the time, to collect on the favor owed. Whether that constitutes another adventure is up to the GM!</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vkXZ1CDW49ufIquY":3},"flags":{},"_id":"kXIlX1Et5YLkNvwl"}

The site, possibly an outpost of the Azlanti on the mainland or some kind of research station, has produced a wealth of archaeologically significant finds (pot shards, mural fragments, and other ephemera) but the most impressive find has been an intact starmetal diadem that Barnabas colorfully named “The Ettercap Crown.” Nearly pristine but not obviously magical, it is an excellent find and Barnabas has been using the item to drum up funding for further exploration. However, a cult of Mazmezz that migrated to Echo Wood from the Worldwound learned of it and desires the crown for their own nefarious purposes. Led by Uttu the Weaver, these cultists have been waging a war of attrition on the dig and have chased Barnabas and his finds all the way to the island of Kortos in an attempt to claim the crown for themselves.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Summary</h2>\n<p>Barnabas Ironeye, an adventurer, archaeologist, and antiquities expert, is returning to his backers in Absalom with several crates of recovered material from his most recent dig, including a spindly diadem of star metal with an arachnid theme that Barnabas has dubbed “the Ettercap Crown” in his correspondence. Unfortunately for him, the dig attracted the attention of a cult of Mazmezz. The cultists have hounded his every step on the journey from the Echo Wood to Absalom, leaving Barnabas harried and desperate. Sending word ahead, Barnabas arranges for the heroes to be hired to meet him at a waystation between Diobel and Absalom, deciding at the last minute to avoid the docks in the major city in the hopes of throwing off pursuit. Unfortunately, the cultists were able to track him down, and the heroes find Barnabas poisoned and struggling to survive on the road to the waystation. As a storm rolls in that quickly begins to flood the area, the heroes must confront the cultists, and finally Uttu the Weaver, in an abandoned barn in order to recover the relics and get an antidote for Barnabas.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Order and notes</h5>\n<p><em>This adventure has been separated into several journalentries so GMs can place map notes on their own maps as appropriate.  The final map is provided and set up for you, import this map from the \"Wayfinder - Maps\" compendium.  Weather effects have been turned on and a clear image can be places as an overhead tile to block the weather from inside the barn using modules.  See the Foundry discord and module discussion channels for how to do this.  A clear image has been provided in the module art folder for GMs who wish to set this up.  Some groups may wish to disable the weather in the scene settings in order to improve performance.  Additionally links for the ladders using Multilevel Tokens module have been set up as well, if the module is not enabled the drawings can be deleted.</em></p>\n<p><em>The order of the adventure is:</em></p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-wayfinder.wayfinder-race-for-the-ettercap-crown.F1KVHiGDychtpw8i]{Getting Started}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-wayfinder.wayfinder-race-for-the-ettercap-crown.BQBnBLi1uYwvGpoJ]{Along the Road (Low 3)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-wayfinder.wayfinder-race-for-the-ettercap-crown.5ZAVssS9LT7InmC5]{Waystation (Moderate 3)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-wayfinder.wayfinder-race-for-the-ettercap-crown.eH8eSZkPRo9IwMwN]{Into the Storm (Moderate 3)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-wayfinder.wayfinder-race-for-the-ettercap-crown.MFGbPPA4bKELsNU8]{The Weaver in the Barn (Severe 3)}</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vkXZ1CDW49ufIquY":3},"flags":{}}
