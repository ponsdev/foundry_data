*New FX :*
- A pixelate filter (sample added in the portfolio)

*Fixed issues :*
- Added the v0.2.0 missing macros in the portfolio.

## Managing Presets

*Added new functions :*

To add a preset in your library :
```javascript
(async) TokenMagic.addPreset(<presetName>,<params>,optional <silent>)

// Example
// You don't need to add a filterId when creating a preset. The filterId is created with the preset name.
// In the example below, the filterId will be equal to "FunnyGlow"
// If your preset is composed of multiple filter types, all the filterId will share the preset name
let params =
           [{
               filterType: "glow",
               filterId: "funnyAlternateGlow",
               color: Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215)
           }];
TokenMagic.addPreset("FunnyGlow",params);
```
To delete a preset in your library :
```javascript
(async) TokenMagic.deletePreset(<presetName>,optional <silent>);
```
To get a preset from your library :
```javascript
TokenMagic.getPreset(<presetName>);
```

To export your library in a json file
```javascript
TokenMagic.exportPresetLibrary(optional <exportName>);
```

To import presets into your library (open a file picker dialog)
```javascript
(async) TokenMagic.importPresetLibrary();
```

To import presets into your library from a local path
```javascript
(async) TokenMagic.importPresetLibraryFromPath(<path>);
```

To import presets into your library from an URL
```javascript
(async) TokenMagic.importPresetLibraryFromURL(<URL>);
```

To reset the preset library with the default presets (confirmation is requested)
```javascript
(async) TokenMagic.resetPresetLibrary();
```

*A new option in the module option panel allow overwrite of duplicates (by preset name) on import.
By default, duplicates are ignored.*

### Functions updates

You can use presets with those functions below, by replacing the params with a preset name :
```javascript
TokenMagic.addFilters
TokenMagic.addFiltersOnSelected
TokenMagic.addFiltersOnTargeted
TokenMagic.addUpdateFiltersOnSelected
TokenMagic.addUpdateFiltersOnTargeted
TokenMagic.updateFiltersOnSelected
TokenMagic.updateFiltersOnTargeted
TokenMagic.updateFiltersByPlaceable

// Example
TokenMagic.addFiltersOnTargeted("dead");
```
