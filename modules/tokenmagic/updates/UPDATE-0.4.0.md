## Working with the zOrder property

If you want to work with this new property, you must activate the option in the module option panel.

The zOrder allows the filters to be applied on a Placeable in a specific order: from the smallest zOrder to the highest.

A concrete example: you have applied an aura to a token, then you apply a mirror image, the aura will also be processed by the mirror image, which is probably not the desired effect. By assigning a zOrder to your effects, you can determine that the mirror image should apply before the aura.

You will find below a table with the filters and their default zOrder. The default zOrder can be overriden in the parameters of the filters. Suggestions and critics are welcome if you think that the default zOrder should be changed for specific filters.
