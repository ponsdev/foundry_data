# Token Magic FX - Update v0.5.0-beta

First of all, I want to thank dev7355608 for his incredible contribution to this release!
Long live to dev7355608!

*New filter :*
- Sprite filter (beta) : to link sprites and manipulate them (color, translation, rotation, etc.)
- The token magic compendium has been updated with 3 new sprite filter macro

*Added/Changed :*
- An effect selector macro has been added to the token magic compendium, it works in tandem with any TMFX compendium (many thanks to Bruno Calado!)
- New automatic framerate setting to "release the kraken!"
- New automatically hide template effects setting that hides the border of textured templates.
- New sticky property. If set to true, the filter effect rotates with the target.
- The anchor point (anchorX/anchorY) isn't changed by other filters anymore.
- Default template on hover now shows the grid highlight when hovering over the template and not only when hovering over the control icon on the template layer.
- LibWrapper compatibility.
- The Korean language support : many thanks to KLO!
- The Chinese language support : many thanks to Zeteticl!
- Updated PIXI community filters
- A lot of framework improvements!

*Fixed Issues :*
- Filters were not working properly if the target was rotated.
- Distortion and Blur filters were not working properly when zooming in/out.
- Token Magic was not working if a route prefix was set.
- Some filters were not working properly on some MacOs and Linux distributions. 
- And a lot of other small fixes!
