She learns about them from her wisp allies and you can thereafter use her whenever her appearance might cause the most tension. She should attack at least once on each dungeon level, as often as every couple of days. You shouldn't have Belcorra fight alongside other creatures until the adventure's finale-she's tough enough on her own!</p>\n<p>Each time Belcorra attacks, she learns more about how the heroes fight and adapts her tactics and her preparations. She might cast <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.tgIhRUFtgDSELpJE]{Spell Immunity}</em> to protect herself from the heroes' most effective spells, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.uqlxMQQeSGWEVjki]{True Seeing}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.jwK43yKsHTkJQvQ9]{See Invisibility}</em> to keep them in sight, or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic}</em> to counter their magical defenses. She mocks the heroes for their failures and rages at their successes-remember, she has been aware of them since her test firing of <em>Gauntlight's</em> beam in \"Ruins of Gauntlight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>First Attack</strong> As soon as Belcorra realizes the heroes' presence, she seeks them out, traveling through the <em>Gauntlight</em> footprint (areas <strong>A37</strong> and <strong>B28</strong>). She casts <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0XP2XOxT9VSiXFDr]{Phantasmal Calamity}</em> at a distance and retreats, moving through walls if necessary so the heroes can't follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Attack</strong> Belcorra wants the heroes to fear her, so she approaches them more closely the second time and uses single-target spells like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.5BbU1V6wGSGbrmRD]{Feeblemind}</em> and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.tlcrVRqW1MSKJ5IC]{Phantasmal Killer}</em> while demanding the heroes flee her Abomination Vaults. With her message delivered, she retreats after only a few rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Later Attacks</strong> Once the heroes have recovered a <em>fulcrum lens</em> or the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.JwHNSaiwwqF7VCC5]{Fulcrum Lattice}</em>, Belcorra considers the heroes an actual threat, but her anger overrides her caution. She attacks with her full might, using her Corrupting Gaze and ghostly hand along with her spells. If she defeats a hero, she retreats, confident that they'll leave her alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraging Agents</strong> Belcorra has several living allies within the Abomination Vaults, including the urdefhan cult and the Children of Belcorra. She might send these groups after the heroes, insisting they let the heroes know they're acting on Belcorra's orders. Fortunately, neither group can muster large numbers, so the heroes should be able to manage an attack from them.</p>\n<p><strong>Killing Allies</strong> Belcorra learns if the heroes make alliances, such as with nearby calignis or drow. She knows better than to face powerful, entrenched leaders like Galudu or Quara, but she might murder a few guards or direct monsters where they can most damage the heroes' allies. It's important to Belcorra that she leave some evidence (usually a single, injured survivor) to let the heroes know she had orchestrated the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Footprint</strong> Belcorra is most effective fighting the heroes who enter the <em>Gauntlight</em> footprint (areas <strong>A37</strong> and <strong>B28</strong>) due to her Haunted Lighthouse ability.</p>\n<p><strong>The Final Attack</strong> If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.CTiLugp5ptSItEqN]{Ebon Fulcrum Lens}</em> to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum. Belcorra doesn't ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her there without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they'll need to retreat to collect the <em>fulcrum lenses</em> and return to face her again.

If the creature is unwilling to accept the ritual, it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The ritual succeeds and the target takes a -4 status penalty to Will saves to end the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The ritual succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ritual fails and the target instead hates you, becoming hostile to you for the duration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can use <em>inveigle</em> on a creature up to 1 mile away throughout the casting, as long as you have a lock of hair, a drop of blood, or some other piece of the creature's body, which you mix into the oils used in the cost. The base cost increases to 100 gp. The duration is shorter than normal, based on how large a piece of the creature's body you use.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster.

Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage.

Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness. Few fiends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway's memory-sapping qualities.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>These desert-based will-o'-wisps deal fire damage rather than electricity and delight in setting their victims aflame, relishing the resulting screams that echo across the landscape. They can quench their glow like other will-o'-wisps, but the nearer they remain to their burning victims, the more obvious their heat shimmer appears in the air.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #164: Hands of the Devil"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["magic"]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["aklo","common"]},"rarity":"common","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"sm"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["aberration","air"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"2rAKighB6Ywhk5s3","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["light-the-living-wick"]},"bonus":{"value":17},"damageRolls":{"jtguda2tjozvfz78bzs3":{"damage":"2d4+4","damageType":"fire"}},"description":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":["fire","magical"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Flare","sort":100000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"51r9xhJpaBdZxkK3","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"wChn2PEw9GYziq2n","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Template[type:emanation|distance:20]{20 feet} @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.v61oEQaDdcRpaZ9X]{Aura}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A will-o'-wisp is itself naturally invisible, but glows with a colored light, casting bright light in the aura and making it visible.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":["aura","light"]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Glow","sort":300000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"3Eksrmh390T4SrP7","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>A will-o'-wisp is immune to all spells except <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HRb2doyaLtaoCfi3]{Faerie Fire}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE]{Glitterdust}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}</em>, and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Oj1PJBMQD9vuwCv7]{Maze}</em>.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Magic Immunity","sort":400000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"yDdnC4S3nrhfHYil","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"description":{"value":"<p>The dune candle extinguishes its glow, becoming @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #163: Ruins of Gauntlight"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":8}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["bleed","death-effects","disease","doomed","drained","fatigued","healing","mental","necromancy","nonlethal-attacks","paralyzed","poison","sickened","unconscious"]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common"]},"rarity":"unique","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["construct","soulbound"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"AAFWcmRlGxb76Pps","data":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":2,"prepared":[],"value":2},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":20,"mod":0,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"j0vMF2M7o6CLR4Tk","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":""},"areasize":{"value":""},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.
