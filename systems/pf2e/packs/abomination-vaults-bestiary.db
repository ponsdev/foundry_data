She learns about them from her wisp allies and you can thereafter use her whenever her appearance might cause the most tension. She should attack at least once on each dungeon level, as often as every couple of days. You shouldn&rsquo;t have Belcorra fight alongside other creatures until the adventure&rsquo;s finale&mdash;she&rsquo;s tough enough on her own!</p>\n<p>Each time Belcorra attacks, she learns more about how the heroes fight and adapts her tactics and her preparations. She might cast spell immunity to protect herself from the heroes&rsquo; most effective spells, true seeing or see invisibility to keep them in sight, or dispel magic to counter their magical defenses. She mocks the heroes for their failures and rages at their successes&mdash;remember, she has been aware of them since her test firing of Gauntlight&rsquo;s beam in &ldquo;Ruins of Gauntlight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>First Attack</strong>: As soon as Belcorra realizes the heroes&rsquo; presence, she seeks them out, traveling through the Gauntlight footprint (areas A37 and B28). She casts phantasmal calamity at a distance and retreats, moving through walls if necessary so the heroes can&rsquo;t follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Attack</strong>: Belcorra wants the heroes to fear her, so she approaches them more closely the second time and uses single-target spells like feeblemind and phantasmal killer while demanding the heroes flee her Abomination Vaults. With her message delivered, she retreats after only a few rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Later Attacks</strong>: Once the heroes have recovered a fulcrum lens or the Fulcrum Lattice, Belcorra considers the heroes an actual threat, but her anger overrides her caution. She attacks with her full might, using her Corrupting Gaze and ghostly hand along with her spells. If she defeats a hero, she retreats, confident that they&rsquo;ll leave her alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraging Agents</strong>: Belcorra has several living allies within the Abomination Vaults, including the urdefhan cult and the Children of Belcorra. She might send these groups after the heroes, insisting they let the heroes know they&rsquo;re acting on Belcorra&rsquo;s orders. Fortunately, neither group can muster large numbers, so the heroes should be able to manage an attack from them.</p>\n<p><strong>Killing Allies</strong>: Belcorra learns if the heroes make alliances, such as with nearby calignis or drow. She knows better than to face powerful, entrenched leaders like Galudu or Quara, but she might murder a few guards or direct monsters where they can most damage the heroes&rsquo; allies. It&rsquo;s important to Belcorra that she leave some evidence (usually a single, injured survivor) to let the heroes know she had orchestrated the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Footprint</strong>: Belcorra is most effective fighting the heroes who enter the Gauntlight footprint (areas A37 and B28) due to her Haunted Lighthouse ability.</p>\n<p><strong>The Final Attack</strong>: If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the Ebon Fulcrum Lens to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum. Belcorra doesn&rsquo;t ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her there without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they&rsquo;ll need to retreat to collect the fulcrum lenses and return to face her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth&rsquo;s gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.</p>","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":12},"nethysUrl":"","recallKnowledgeText":"","sidebarText":"","source":{"value":""}},"items":{"0":{"data":{"slots":{"slot1":{"value":4},"slot2":{"value":4},"slot3":{"value":4},"slot4":{"value":4},"slot5":{"value":4},"slot6":{"value":4}}}},"1":{"data":{"slots":{"slot6":{"value":2}}}},"1Y2VBpO6qwQGZLlz":{"data":{"slots":{"slot6":{"max":2}}}},"I21ebMX64IyNsYAb":{"data":{"slots":{"slot1":{"max":4},"slot2":{"max":4},"slot3":{"max":4},"slot4":{"max":4},"slot5":{"max":4},"slot6":{"max":4}}}}},"martial":{"advanced":{"rank":0,"value":0},"heavy":{"rank":0,"value":0},"light":{"rank":0,"value":0},"martial":{"rank":0,"value":0},"medium":{"rank":0,"value":0},"simple":{"rank":0,"value":0},"unarmed":{"rank":0,"value":0},"unarmored":{"rank":0,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"ability":"con","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"ability":"dex","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":22},"will":{"ability":"wis","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":20}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0},"spell1":{"max":0},"spell10":{"max":0},"spell11":{"max":0},"spell2":{"max":0},"spell3":{"max":0},"spell4":{"max":0},"spell5":{"max":0},"spell6":{"max":0},"spell7":{"max":0},"spell8":{"max":0},"spell9":{"max":0}},"statusEffects":[],"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["death effects","disease","paralyzed","poison","precision","unconscious"]},"dr":[{"exceptions":"except force, ghost touch, or positive;

This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell.

If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments (page 6), adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.<br /><br /> Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round.

A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling).
