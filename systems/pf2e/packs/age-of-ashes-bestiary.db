It has no magic items except weapon potency runes. The duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target's normal damage but don't apply added effects, since it doesn't have special abilities. The spell automatically ends if the duplicate's Hit Points drop to 0. The duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities.

Further complicating all of this is the deculi's infrared vision, which anatomists agree is completely unheard of in mammalian species on Golarion. The most credible theories suggest that the deculi is not from Golarion at all, but arrived here long ago from some part of the Material Plane beyond the reckoning of most mortals.","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #148: Fires of the Haunted City"}},"martial":{"advanced":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"heavy":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"light":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"martial":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"medium":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"simple":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmed":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmored":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"ability":"con","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":21},"reflex":{"ability":"dex","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":26},"will":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":18}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""}},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"arc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"cra":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dec":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"itm":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"nat":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"occ":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"prf":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"rel":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"soc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"thi":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0},"spell1":{"max":0},"spell10":{"max":0},"spell11":{"max":0},"spell2":{"max":0},"spell3":{"max":0},"spell4":{"max":0},"spell5":{"max":0},"spell6":{"max":0},"spell7":{"max":0},"spell8":{"max":0},"spell9":{"max":0}},"statusEffects":[],"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["visual"]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"can't speak any language","selected":[],"value":["undercommon","custom"]},"rarity":{"value":"Common"},"senses":{"value":"infrared vision 60 feet, no vision"},"size":{"value":"lg"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["beast"]}}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.age-of-ashes-bestiary.5jFR05QRixpOChRy"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"B2pDIbpVOV0J4SPQ","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":""},"displayLevel":{},"displayLevels":{},"focus":{"points":1,"pool":1},"item":{"value":0},"prepared":{"value":"Innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":"32","item":0,"mod":0,"value":22},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"3gWa9FrY30i7oOSk","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"burst","value":20},"components":{"value":"material, somatic, verbal"},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"applyMod":false,"value":""},"damageType":{"value":""},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from penetrating or emanating within the area.

The species originated from a type of large feral boar native to Nidal's shadowy Uskwood, and blood boars retain their predecessors' gray fur, red eyes, and exceptional senses. The intensive breeding process to produce blood boars-augmented by the selective application of magic-grants the creatures an unparalleled awareness of blood, including the ability to precisely detect a bloodied creature's location and movements, allowing the boars to track their prey from up to a mile away.<br /><br /> Blood boars' keepers groom and mark the animals to enhance their already unsettling appearance. While from a distance, a blood boar might be mistaken for an ordinary pig, up close the differences are stark. Blood-red eyes, ashen fur, and unnaturally sharp tusks frame hundreds of pounds of raw muscle, the veins of which can be seen through the boar's ghastly pale flesh. Chains, manacles, and spikes are typical blood boar accessories, ensuring the boars are as fearsome as possible.<br /><br /> A blood boar's ability to track its quarry using only the scent of the target's blood has been the bane of many thieves, brigands, and the occasional illicit lover, but none have as much cause to fear the beasts as slaves in pursuit of freedom. Even washing off spilled blood does nothing to deter the blood boar's pursuit if it already has the scent. As a result, many halflings in the Bellflower Network zealously practice disarming and nonlethal combat techniques specifically to avoid accidental bloodshed during an escape.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":6},"nethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=454","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge : DC 22","sidebarText":"<h3 class=\"title\">Blood Boar Handlers</h3>Few slavers own their own blood boars.

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.<br /><br /> Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.<br /><br /> Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.<br /><br /> Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.<br /><br /> Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":13},"nethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=252","recallKnowledgeText":"recall knowledge Occultism DC 41","sidebarText":"","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #148: Fires of the Haunted City"}},"martial":{"advanced":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"heavy":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"light":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"martial":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"medium":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"simple":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmed":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmored":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"ability":"con","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":26},"reflex":{"ability":"dex","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":20},"will":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":23}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""}},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"arc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"cra":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dec":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"itm":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"nat":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"occ":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"prf":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"rel":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"soc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"thi":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0},"spell1":{"max":0},"spell10":{"max":0},"spell11":{"max":0},"spell2":{"max":0},"spell3":{"max":0},"spell4":{"max":0},"spell5":{"max":0},"spell6":{"max":0},"spell7":{"max":0},"spell8":{"max":0},"spell9":{"max":0}},"statusEffects":[],"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["aklo","terran","undercommon"]},"rarity":{"value":"unique"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"lg"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["aberration"]}}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.age-of-ashes-bestiary.CJVRPFTKuJroiD5C"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"Kz3r31N7mvhlPQc8","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":""},"displayLevel":{},"displayLevels":{},"focus":{"points":1,"pool":1},"item":{"value":0},"prepared":{"value":"Innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":"33","item":0,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spellss","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"s6wPKP0eRMX10MOB","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":null},"components":{"value":"somatic, verbal"},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"applyMod":false,"value":""},"damageType":{"value":""},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>You try to turn the target's flesh into stone.

While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom}. Some forms of<em>imprisonment</em>can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Object</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom} ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]{Haste} spell.

They make their dens in the shallows of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural swamps or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons spend most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as fish or waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins, grauladons often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the corpses to keep scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is 16 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds.<br /><br /> A grauladon's stench may seem supernaturally disgusting, but it is simply the result of the creature's fetid habitat and diet of rotting, waterlogged meat. As grauladons' exhalations bear a passing resemblance to dragons' breath, they have earned the nickname &quot;mud drakes&quot; from rural folk.<br /><br /> Grauladons can be found in both fresh and brackish water in most temperate climates. They prefer to lair in shallow waters, particularly where reeds or other foliage conceal their bulk from unsuspecting prey. Grauladons are highly territorial and won't tolerate other predators living or hunting near their homes.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":2},"nethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=435","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge : DC 18","sidebarText":"<h3 class=\"title\">Saltwater Grauladons</h3>Although the vast majority of grauladons live in fresh or brackish waters, a rare grauladon species lives in and along saltwater coasts.

Many who perish in service to a Hellknight order are glad to rest after having served their masters so faithfully, but others seek to continue their work even in death. When a Hellknight is decapitated, the ghostly undead known as a hellcrown is an occasional result. Consumed by the desire to bring about order by inflicting cruelty, hellcrowns haunt battlefields and abandoned castles, slaying all they encounter. A strange fusion of spirit and steel, a hellcrown has no corporeal form by itself, but instead inhabits the helmet it so proudly wore in life. Dangling from the helmet like a shroud is a shadow of the former Hellknight's spine, adding to the creature's terrifyingly gruesome appearance. Hellknights regard hellcrowns with a mixture of disgust and respect, considering the individuals who transform into these floating undead to have been resolute in purpose but weak in body.<br /><br /> A hellcrown usually manifests hours or longer after its body's death, and only when its body is unattended; this might even take days if the Hellknight perished in a major battle. Typically, no recognizable fragment of the Hellknight's former personality survives the grisly transformation into a hellcrown, but in rare and particularly tragic cases a hellcrown might remember its life and hold grudges against those it views as the cause of its death. Regardless of whether they retain memories of their lives or have lost all former sense of self, hellcrowns linger around the site of their death, reminding all they encounter of the merciless principles of their order.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":1},"nethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=437","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge : DC 17","sidebarText":"<h3 class=\"title\">Other Hellcrowns</h3>The stats below reflect a hellcrown that arose from a knight of the Order of the Nail.

The door often bears a round disk or similar embossment that resembles a shield boss designed for bashing, and the bar that can be lowered to block entry resembles an arm clasping a longsword by the hilt. The original doorwardens crafted by the elves included a motif of elven armor and a metal mask in the style of Alseta's own, though other cultures embellish their own doorwardens with their own themes and sometimes even their own ancestral weapons, such as axes for dwarven doorwardens.<br /><br /> Doorwardens sometimes know about the chambers they guard, and they have been known to speak to trespassers, especially elves.

As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.<br /><br /> In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities.

Their favorite meal, however, is the odd adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest.<br /><br /> These strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime, three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue.<br /><br /> A tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack, and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases. This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a tixitog's lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat that follows closely behind.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":3},"nethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=438","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge : DC 20","sidebarText":"<h3 class=\"title\">Talking with Tixitogs</h3>Tixitogs live long lives, and they have cultivated knowledge over the years that may prove useful for adventurers who can coax it from them.

As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.<br /><br /> Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new-and even more insidious-agenda.<br

This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments (page 6), adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.<br /><br /> Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round.

While it usually feeds on lizards, big insects, and other small creatures, the emperor bird is highly territorial and not afraid to attack larger prey. Its beak, resembling that of the much smaller peafowl, is exceptionally sharp, but its deadliest weapon is its tail-the long, whiplike blades of bone hidden among its tail feathers are a nasty surprise for any predator trying to sneak up on the bird.<br /><br /> The emperor bird was given its current name 2,000 years ago when Taldor's Sixth Army of Exploration ventured into the Mwangi Expanse. When the legion spotted this 6-foot-long bird with its spectacular multicolored feathers trailing from its tail, wings, and crest, the soldiers thought the bird regal enough to suit their emperor, disregarding the name the Mwangi had given to the bird generations before, bebaki.<br /><br /> Keeping an emperor bird was, for many years, a sign of prestige among the nobility of Taldor. That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest.<br /><br /> The emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators. Not only are the feathers beautiful, but they are actually magical-a fact that has piqued the interest of alchemists and wizards alike, many of whom have spent decades capturing and breeding emperor birds in the hope of unlocking their arcane secrets.

The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good outsider you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you and the secondary casters each take your places at specific points at the diagram's edge where power concentrates.<br /></p>\n<p>You conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange for payment. A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Q690d3mw3TUrKX7E]{Geas} on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract.
