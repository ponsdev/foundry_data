If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal outfits and thieves' guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek-for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.<br /><br /> Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa's gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster's life.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":8},"nethysUrl":"","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge : DC 23","sidebarText":"","source":{"value":""}},"martial":{"advanced":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"heavy":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"light":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"martial":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"medium":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"simple":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmed":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmored":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"ability":"con","base":17,"breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"ability":"dex","base":18,"breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":16},"will":{"ability":"wis","base":16,"breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""}},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"arc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"cra":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dec":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"itm":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"nat":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"occ":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"prf":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"rel":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"soc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"thi":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0},"spell1":{"max":0},"spell10":{"max":0},"spell11":{"max":0},"spell2":{"max":0},"spell3":{"max":0},"spell4":{"max":0},"spell5":{"max":0},"spell6":{"max":0},"spell7":{"max":0},"spell8":{"max":0},"spell9":{"max":0}},"statusEffects":[],"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common"]},"rarity":{"value":"unique"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["humanoid"]}}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.blog-bestiary.Nd54wB2wWnpPbHCc"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","items":[{"_id":"yyYgxy1b1M5I29dM","data":{"MAP":{"value":""},"ability":{"value":"dex"},"baseItem":null,"bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"brokenThreshold":{"value":0},"bulkCapacity":{"value":""},"collapsed":{"value":false},"containerId":{"value":""},"damage":{"damageType":"piercing","dice":1,"die":"d6","value":""},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>This shortbow is made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together to increase the power of its pull and the force of its projectile.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.<br /><br /> These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.<br /><br /> Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.<br /><br /> Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.<br /><br
