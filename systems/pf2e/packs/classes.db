Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.<br /><br />Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br /><br />As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.<br /><br />Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.<br /><br />You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-17), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.<br /><br />Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.<br /><br />At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting.

Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WILXkjU5Yq3yw10r]{Counter Performance} composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.</p>\n<h3><strong>Composition Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Inspire Courage} composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Muses</h2>\n<p>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.</p>\n<p>Muses can be found here: @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.YMBsi4bndRAk5CX4]{Maestro}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.y0jGimYdMGDJWrEq]{Polymath}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.4ripp6EfdVpS0d60]{Enigma}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.N03BtRvjX9TeHRa4]{Warrior Muse}.</p>\n<h2>Occult Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.<br /><br />Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-6: Bard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Bard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Bard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the occult. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your command of occult magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Magnum Opus<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard spellcasting.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>On the Case</h2>\n<p>As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one reaction you can use to investigate cases: @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.25WDi1cVUrW92sUj]{Clue In}.</p>\n<h2>Devise a Strategem</h2>\n<p>You can play out a battle in your head, using brains rather than brawn to execute an attack.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.m0f2B7G9eaaTmhFL]{Devise a Strategem}</p>\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<p>Your studies have made you savvy in many areas,; but one in particular drew your intense interest.</p>\n<p>Choose a methodology. The methodologies presented in this book are as follow:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ln2Y1a4SxlU9sizX]{Alchemical Sciences Methodology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.g3mNzNphtVxyR9Xr]{Empiricism Methology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.O3IX7rTxXWWvDVM3]{Forensic Medicine Methodology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.UIHUNNYZyQ3p4Vmo]{Interrogation Methodology}</p>\n<h2>Investigator Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Strike</h2>\n<p>When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.</p>\n<p>As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase.

Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success.

When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Master Detective<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>As a master detective, you can solve any case and find all the clues available. If you're pursuing the subject of a lead and you enter a new location that includes another clue toward solving the mystery, the GM informs you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object, person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue, the GM informs you that you've done so. If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to master.</p>"},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"hp":8,"items":{"0abc3":{"id":"malYpr0CYL4fDGhr","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/deductive-improvisation.webp","level":"11","name":"Deductive

It can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it - and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature's call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service.</em><br /><br /><strong>Key Ability: WISDOM</strong><br />At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom.<br /><br /><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong><br />You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Druid</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can't have all that they desire.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.</li>\n<li>Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it.</li>\n<li>Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it.</li>\n<li>Assume you're a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild.</li>\n<li>Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">The following acts are anathema to all druids:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using metal armor or shields.</li>\n<li>Despoiling natural places.</li>\n<li>Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order's entry.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">See specific orders for more information.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Language</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.</p>\n<h2>Druidic Order</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Orders can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.POBvoXifa9HaejAg]{Animal}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.u4nlOzPj2WHkIj9l]{Leaf}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.acqqlYmti8D9QJi0]{Storm}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.v0EjtiwdeMj8ykI0]{Wild}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Primal Spellcasting</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-11: Druid Spells per Day.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The primal hierophant class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.</p>\n<h2>Druid Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a druid class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.</p>\n<p>Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<p>A list of all deities can be found in the Deities compendium.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual.</p>\n<h2>Divine Font</h2>\n<p>Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wdA52JJnsuQWeyqz]{Harm} spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em>. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Font</strong>: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>heal</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmful Font</strong>: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>harm</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-9: Cleric Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your divine font gives you additional <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em> spells of this level.

At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine's second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.</p>\n<p>Doctrines can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZZzLMOUAtBVgV1DF]{Cloistered Cleric} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.0Aocw3igLwna9cjp]{Warpriest}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Cleric Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Defense<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a rogue class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue's Racket</h2>\n<p>As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue's racket.</p>\n<p>Rackets can be found here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.D8qtAo2w4jsqjBrM]{Eldritch Trickster Racket},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RyOkmu0W9svavuAB]{Mastermind Racket},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.3KPZ7svIO6kmmEKH]{Ruffian Racket},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZvfxtUMtfIOLYHyg]{Scoundrel Racket}, and</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.wAh2riuFRzz0edPl]{Thief Racket}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats</h2>\n<p>You gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sneak Attack</h2>\n<p>When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.</p>\n<p>As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Surprise Attack</h2>\n<p>You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are flat-footed to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Deny Advantage<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Tricks<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, as well as the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a flat-footed creature while using an agile or finesse simple weapon or any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for the weapon you're wielding.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Debilitating Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>When taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.bp0Up04x3dzGK5bB]{Debilitating Strike} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You apply one of the following debilitations, which lasts until the end of your next turn. <br /><br /><strong>Debilitation</strong> The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Debilitation</strong> The target becomes enfeebled 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy.

Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor.

Your proficiency ranks increase to master for all simple weapons and unarmed attacks plus the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Double Debilitation<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your opportunistic attacks are particularly detrimental. When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Slippery Mind<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects.

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient esoteric tomes to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader approach that emphasizes the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth.</em><br /><br /><strong>Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE</strong><br />At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</strong><br />You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Wizard</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Invisibility} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.A2JfEKe6BZcTG1S8]{Fly}, you answer with spells like @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE]{Glitterdust} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gPvtmKMRpg9I9D7H]{Earthbind}, leveling the field for your allies.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works-magic in particular.</li>\n<li>Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you're a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you're a universalist).</li>\n<li>Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.</li>\n<li>Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it's too late.</li>\n<li>Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Drain Bonded Item} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day<br /><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</p>\n<h2>Arcane School</h2>\n<p>Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.</p>\n<p>Arcane schools can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gCwcys8CnS102tji]{Arcane School: Abjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SNeVaUBTHwvoO6kr]{Arcane School: Conjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.yobGgrHdgjs5QW5o]{Arcane School: Divination}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHwGACWQEy6kTzcP]{Arcane School: Enchantment}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibhml5y20g5M3Vgd]{Arcane School: Evocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.K6hG7nH8yjmbA0Q9]{Arcane School: Illusion}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uNM7qZQokRKAEd7k]{Arcane School: Necromancy}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.rHxkPijLnQ9O9AGV]{Arcane School: Transmutation} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qczCKdg47eAmCOUD]{Arcane School: Universalist})</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3-19: Wizard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Crimson Libram</em>, or something more academic, like <em>A Field Study in Practical Transmutation</em>.<br /><br />Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The Archwizard's Spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Arcane Thesis</h2>\n<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like \"On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.\"</p>\n<p>Arcane thesis can be found here @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7]{Arcane Thesis}.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through a combination of magic and training, you've learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Archwizard's Spellcraft<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting.

You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.</p>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Alchemical Crafting} feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.</p>\n<h3><strong>Infused Reagents</strong></h3>\n<p>You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.</p>\n<p>As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.</p>\n<h3><strong>Advanced Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quick Alchemy</strong></h3>\n<p>If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NlEZ0piDxg9buXCL]{Quick Alchemy}<span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong> 1 batch of infused reagents<br /><strong>Requirements</strong> You have @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.4ftXXUCBHcf4b0MH]{Alchemist's Tools}, the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and a free hand.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Formula Book</strong></h3>\n<p>An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.XR95taODq1sq82Du]{Inventor} feat.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Research Field</h2>\n<p>Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from an scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research.</p>\n<p>Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formulas book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you can create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.</p>\n<p>Research fields can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.7JbiaZ8bxODM5mzS]{Bomber}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.eNZnx4LISDNftbx2]{Chirurgeon}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tvdb1jkjl2bRZjSp]{Mutagenist} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.P9quO9XZi3OWFe1k]{Toxicologist}).</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.<br /><br />At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Field Discovery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You learn a special discovery depending on your field.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Powerful Alchemy<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Alchemical items you create on the fly are particularily potent. When you use Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've trained to more effectively wield the weapons you find in your lab. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, unarmed attacks, and alchemical bombs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Iron Will<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your mental defenses are an iron fortress. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Perpetual Infusions<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Constant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Double Brew<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to pathogens and ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Perpetual Potency<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your perpetual infusions improve, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create more powerful items with no cost. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Greater Field Discovery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You learn an incredible discovery that advances your understanding of your field.</p>\n<p>See specific research fields for more information.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Alacrity<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your comfort in concocting items is such that you can create three at a time. When using the Quick Alchemy action, you can spend up to three batches of infused reagents to make up to three alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your alchemical concoctions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Perpetual Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected your perpetual infusions, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create even more powerful items at no cost.

Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Devastator<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care about resistance, and your barbarian abilities are unparalleled.

You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki spells are divine or occult spells. You are trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs of that tradition, and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies representing your basic training, which are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Monk Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a monk class feat.</p>\n<h2>Powerful Fist</h2>\n<p>You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a -2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Movement<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed whenever you're not wearing armor. The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have beyond 3rd.</p>\n<h2>Mystic Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item such as @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO]{Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)} to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced martial arts and have now surpassed your former skill. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple weapons increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Path to Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have progressed along your own path to enlightenment. Choose your Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throw. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. When you roll a success on the chosen saving throw, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Metal Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You can adjust your body to make unarmed attacks infused with the mystic energy of rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</p>\n<h2>Monk Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to expert. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for spell attacks and spell DCs with the tradition of magic you use for your ki spells increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Second Path to Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to find perfection in every success. Choose a different saving throw than the one you chose for your path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.</p>\n<h2>Graceful Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You move with perpetual grace in battle, eluding and turning aside blows. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Master Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your skill in using your body as a weapon. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Third Path to Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have made great progress in your personal studies of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws you selected for path to perfection or second path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen type of save increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on the chosen type of save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on the chosen type of save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Adamantine Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>When you focus your will into your limbs, your blows are as unyielding as the hardest of metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine.</p>\n<h2>Graceful Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your sublime movement grants you unparalleled protection and offense. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to legendary, and your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to master. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the tradition of magic you use for your ki spells increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Perfected Form<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have purged incompetence from your techniques. On your first Strike of your turn, if you roll lower than 10, you can treat the attack roll as a 10. This is a fortune effect.</p>"},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"hp":10,"items":{"1fw9s":{"id":"D2AE8RfMlZ3D1FuV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/mystic-strikes.webp","level":3,"name":"Mystic Strikes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"2yqet":{"id":"WiM7X4xmpMx4s6LD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":7,"name":"Weapon Specialization (Level 7)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"4ru9g":{"id":"Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","level":15,"name":"Greater Weapon Specialization (Level 15)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"8tl8t":{"id":"Cq6NjvcKZOMySBVj","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-movement.webp","level":"3","name":"Incredible Movement","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"ai4sq":{"id":"VgZIutWjFl8oZQFi","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/expert-strikes.webp","level":"5","name":"Expert Strikes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"bgd0f":{"id":"2o1Cj7hDayDlslqY","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/alertness.webp","level":5,"name":"Alertness (Level 5)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"c8q3r":{"id":"NLHHHiAcdnZ5ohc2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/flurry-of-blows.webp","level":"1","name":"Flurry of Blows","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"dzcvw":{"id":"JWDfzYub3JfuEtth","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/graceful-legend.webp","level":"17","name":"Graceful Legend","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"iqbky":{"id":"SB8UJ8rZmvbcBweJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/powerful-fist.webp","level":"1","name":"Powerful Fist","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"k3mxz":{"id":"95LI24ZSx0d4qfKX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/graceful-mastery.webp","level":"13","name":"Graceful Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"t4zic":{"id":"lxImO5D0qWp0gXFB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/monk-expertise.webp","level":"9","name":"Monk Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"udbeu":{"id":"CoRfFkisEsHE1e43","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/metal-strikes.webp","level":9,"name":"Metal Strikes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"xcxpa":{"id":"5cthRUkRqRtduVvN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/adamantine-strikes.webp","level":17,"name":"Adamantine Strikes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"zeyz5":{"id":"KmTfg7Sg5va4yU00","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/perfected-form.webp","level":"19","name":"Perfected Form","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"zl9gg":{"id":"0iidKkzC2yy13lIf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/master-strikes.webp","level":13,"name":"Master Strikes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"perception":1,"rules":[],"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":2},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]},"source":{"value":""},"trainedSkills":{"additional":4,"value":[]},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"slug":"monk"},"effects":[{"_id":"blfZPnWU6Usaglf6","changes":[{"key":"data.attributes.perception.rank","mode":4,"value":1},{"key":"data.saves.fortitude.rank","mode":4,"value":2},{"key":"data.saves.reflex.rank","mode":4,"value":2},{"key":"data.saves.will.rank","mode":4,"value":2},{"key":"data.martial.simple.rank","mode":4,"value":1},{"key":"data.martial.unarmed.rank","mode":4,"value":1},{"key":"data.martial.unarmored.rank","mode":4,"value":2},{"key":"data.attributes.classDC.rank","mode":4,"value":1}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"rounds":null,"seconds":null,"startRound":null,"startTime":null,"startTurn":null,"turns":null},"flags":{},"icon":"systems/pf2e/icons/classes/monk.webp","label":"Initial Proficiencies","origin":"","tint":"","transfer":true}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classes.YPxpk9JbMnKjbNLc"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/classes/monk.webp","name":"Monk","permission":{"default":0},"type":"class"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron</h2>\n<p>You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years in devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has chosen you as their vessel to carry forth some agenda in the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power.</p>\n<p>A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem. As you gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are-certain combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas-but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Familiar</h2>\n<p>Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the basic rules for familiars, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting (see below). Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p>Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a scroll of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Q5iIYCFdqJFM31GW]{Learn a Spell} exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p>If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You can cast spells using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown in Table 2-7: Witch Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a witch. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The patron conduit class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hexes</h2>\n<p>Your patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a short-term effect drawn directly from your patron's magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.</p>\n<p>Hexes are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} activity to commune with your familiar.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rMOI8JFJ0nT2mrCF]{Phase Familiar} hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.</p>\n<p><strong>Hex Cantrips</strong></p>\n<p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex cantrips are determined by your patron theme.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Witch Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a witch class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you to avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron's Gift<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.SelPslNtTfzxp7fs]{Patron's Truth} feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Patron Themes</h2>\n<p>Each patron has a theme, regardless of their nature or identity. This theme describes the forces over which the patron grants a witch influence. Some patrons are multifaceted, granting different themes and teaching different lessons to different witches.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your mystery provides you with divine magical power. You can cast spells using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells per day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2-3: Oracle Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as an oracle. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your oracular class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repetoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-3), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Mystery</h2>\n<p>An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.</p>\n<p>Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit.</p>\n<p>The following oracle mysteries are presented in this book.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qvRlih3u7vK3FYUR]{Ancestors Mystery}: Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gjOGOR30Czpnx3tM]{Battle Mystery}: You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.IaxmCkdsPlA52spu]{Bones Mystery}: Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RI2EMRBBPNSoTJXu]{Cosmos Mystery}: You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.GTSvbFb36InvuH0w]{Flames Mystery}: You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.o1gGG36wpn9mxeop]{Life Mystery}: The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tZBb3Kh4nJcNoUFI]{Lore Mystery}: You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.W9cF7wZztLDb1WGY]{Tempest Mystery}: Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong></p>\n<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus}activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.</p>\n<p>You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracular Curse</strong></p>\n<p>Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>\n<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.</p>\n<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{True Strike} (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OyFCwQuw8XRazsNr]{Remove Curse} and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.</p>\n<h2>Oracle Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.<br /><br />At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Major Curse<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Curse<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse.</p>\n<p>When affected by your extreme curse, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} 2 (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.</p>\n<p>If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Oracular Clarity<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PExiZZTSP4p7TZaW]{Oracular Providence} feat to gain a second slot.</p>"},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"hp":8,"items":{"2lr3d":{"id":"JQAujUXjczVnYDEI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","level":7,"name":"Resolve (Level

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Panache</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\">You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\">You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.21WIfSu7Xd7uKqV8]{Tumble Through} and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below). At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\">While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.pyo0vmxUFIFX2GNl]{Confident Finisher}, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\">Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Swashbuckler's Style</h2>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or-death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action.

Deities often add additional strictures (for instance, @Compendium[pf2e.deities.sZrdzh0ANQnZGXJb]{Torag}'s champions can't show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost impossible for them to follow the redeemer cause). Only rules for good champions appear in this book. Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you're hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.<br /><br />If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don't require those class features. If your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.nxZYP3KGfTSkaW6J]{The Tenets of Good}</h3>\n<p>All champions of good alignment follow these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting of an evil spell.</li>\n<li>You must never knowingly harm an innocent, or allow immediate harm to one through inaction when you know you could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents at an indefinite time in the future, or to sacrifice your life to protect them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.JiY2ZB4FkK8RJm4T]{The Tenets of Evil}</h3>\n<p>All champions of evil alignment follow these tenets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit a purely good act, such as giving something solely out of charity, casting a good spell, or using a good item.</li>\n<li>You must never put another person's needs before your own, and you must never put your own needs before those of your deity. Though you can perform acts others might consider helpful, it must be done with the expectation that it ultimately furthers your own goals or those of your master.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Champion's Reaction</h2>\n<p>Your cause gives you a special reaction. See specific causes for more information.</p>\n<h2>Deific Weapon</h2>\n<p>You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's uncommon, you gain access to it. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).</p>\n<h2>Deity and Cause</h2>\n<p>Champions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a deity to follow; your alignment must be one allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals or alignment are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity's entry. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion's reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion's code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lawful good @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.peEXunfbSD8WcMFk]{Paladin}</li>\n<li>Neutral good @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.UyuwFp0jQqYL2AdF]{Redeemer}</li>\n<li>Chaotic good @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.FCoMFUsth4xB4veC]{Liberator}</li>\n<li>Lawful evil @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.HiIvez0TqESbleB5]{Tyrant}</li>\n<li>Neutral evil @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.8YIA0jh64Ecz0TG6]{Desecrator}</li>\n<li>Chaotic evil @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.EQ6DVIQHAUXUhY6Y]{Antipaladin}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Devotion Spells</h2>\n<p>Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Divine Ally<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed.</p>\n<p>The following are divine allies:</p>\n<p><strong>Blade Ally:</strong> A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO]{Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)} when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune.</p>\n<p>For a champion following the tenets of good, choose @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.LwQb7ryTC8FlOXgX]{Disrupting}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.JQdwHECogcTzdd8R]{Ghost Touch}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.qlunQzfnzPQpMG6U]{Returning}, or @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.roeYtwlIe65BPMJ1]{Shifting}. For a champion following the tenets of evil, choose @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.P6v2AtJw7AUwaDzf]{Fearsome}, @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.qlunQzfnzPQpMG6U]{Returning}, or @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.roeYtwlIe65BPMJ1]{Shifting}. You also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Shield Ally</strong>: A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half.</p>\n<p><strong>Steed Ally</strong>: You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Champion Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and divine spell attack rolls and DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Smite<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your champion's reaction improves.</p>\n<p>See specific causes for more information.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Will<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Exalt<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your champion's reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing them to benefit as well.</p>\n<p>See specific causes for more information.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Champion Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered your arsenal of champion techniques and divine spells. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Armor<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You shield yourself with steel as easily as with faith. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Hero's Defiance<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can defy fate and continue fighting as long as you have divine energy.

spell.</p>"},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"hp":10,"items":{"06620":{"id":"x5jaCJxsmD5sx3KB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-expertise.webp","level":7,"name":"Armor
