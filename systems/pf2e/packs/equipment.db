According to the introduction, the author’s original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved—by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don’t know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth’s cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death— though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose—as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome’s curse, Empty Death.</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth’s cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book’s sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p>The Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you can’t activate any of them while you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Investigate);</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death). Each time you use this ability after the first in a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the Empty Death.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, Interact;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You read aloud a phrase from the book and target a single incorporeal undead creature within 30 feet. That undead creature takes 5d6 positive damage (DC 27 basic Will save) as portions of their incorporeal being are consumed in patches of seven equally spaced holes. Each time you use this ability after the first in a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the Empty Death.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> command,</p>\n<p><strong>Interact</strong>; Frequency once per day;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You invoke a tale from The Whispering Reeds that parallels the situation, environment, or creatures nearby. Eerie mists and indistinct whispers rise in a 20-foot emanation around you, and clusters of seven perfectly spaced divots manifest in the ground, vegetation, and flesh of creatures in the emanation other than yourself and up to three creatures you designate at the time of activation. Creatures afflicted with these divots suffer from agonizing mental anguish in the form of crippling despair and take 4d6 mental damage (DC 27 basic Will save). The mists, whispers, and strange divots fade away at the end of the round, but any creature that takes mental damage from the effect also takes a –1 penalty to saving throws against effects with the emotion trait for 1 minute. You are exposed to the Empty Death each time you use this ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> Cast a Spell;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast one of the following spells at the lowest level possible (unless otherwise specified): @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.GaRQlC9Yw1BGKHfN]{Crushing Despair} (one target within 30 feet only), @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4koZzrnMXhhosn0D]{Fear} (3rd), @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Mkbq9xlAUxHUHyR2]{Paranoia}, or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.tlcrVRqW1MSKJ5IC]{Phantasmal Killer}. You are exposed to the Empty Death each time you use this ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Empty Death (curse, necromancy, occult)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> DC 27 Will;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> If you activate The Whispering Reeds and are not a worshipper of Nhimbaloth, you become stupefied 2 for 24 hours as your thoughts fill with paranoia that something is watching you from the other side of death. If you die while affected by the Empty Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost. Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check— failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is consumed in this way does not travel to the River of Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only be restored to life via a 10th-level spell effect or ritual like @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Copies of The Whispering Reeds have no special protections and can be destroyed like any regular book, but doing so exposes the one who destroyed the book to the Empty Death.</p>"},"equipped":{"value":false},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"hardness":{"value":0},"hp":{"value":0},"identification":{"status":"identified"},"identified":{"value":true},"invested":{"value":false},"level":{"value":"10"},"maxHp":{"value":0},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"preciousMaterial":{"value":""},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":""},"price":{"value":"0"},"quantity":{"value":"1"},"rules":[],"size":{"value":"med"},"source":{"value":""},"stackGroup":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"rare"},"usage":{"value":"held-in-two-hands"},"value":["artifact","divination","occult"]},"usage":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":"2"},"slug":"the-whispering-reeds"},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.QT1jTPlf3ATYUh4I"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/artifacts/the-whispering-reeds.webp","name":"The Whispering Reeds","permission":{"default":0},"type":"equipment"}

The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces.

On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.)

Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of Nhimbaloth. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of areas within Gauntlight and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.</p>\n<p>In Gauntlight’s current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below. By swapping in a series of magical lighthouse lenses that focus Nhimbaloth’s baleful gaze—lenses so powerful that even Belcorra takes special care with them—the artifact gains significantly greater power, including the ability to reach all the way to Absalom and to activate its effects every minute. These lenses are described in “Eyes of Empty Death,” the third adventure in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>To activate Gauntlight, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in “Eyes of Empty Death”). From this point, a creature can observe the world outside remotely through Gauntlight’s lens, including any area Gauntlight’s beam can reach.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> Interact;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight’s lens and illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point within 1 mile. The light saturates the region, causing any corpses in the area or within 10 feet of the surface of the illuminated area to animate as level –1 undead (typically as skeleton guards or zombie shamblers). Once animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until then, they remain uncontrolled and are driven only by the desire to slaughter the living. If Gauntlight is fully restored, the undead instead animate as any Common undead of 15th level or less, as the user wishes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> Interact;</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight’s lens and illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point within 1 mile.

If Gauntlight is fully restored, any number of creatures within Gauntlight of 15th level or lower can be transported. This is a teleportation effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If Belcorra's ghost is permanently destroyed, Gauntlight loses all of its magical properties and collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.</p>"},"equipped":{"value":false},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"hardness":{"value":0},"hp":{"value":0},"identification":{"status":"identified"},"identified":{"value":true},"invested":{"value":false},"level":{"value":"20"},"maxHp":{"value":0},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"preciousMaterial":{"value":""},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":""},"price":{"value":"0"},"quantity":{"value":"1"},"rules":[],"size":{"value":"med"},"source":{"value":""},"stackGroup":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"unique"},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"value":["artifact","magical","necromancy"]},"usage":{"value":""},"weight":{"value":"-"},"slug":"gauntlight"},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Y12bRscT79LCpz4k"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/artifacts/gauntlight.webp","name":"Gauntlight","permission":{"default":0},"type":"equipment"}

At the end of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is part of the original, separated from the rest based on the last quality set by the prism's first activation. For instance, if you set the prism to \"good,\" one creature would have all the original creature's good aspects and the other would be the original creature's evil side. Unless you selected a physical quality, both new creatures look just like the original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower than the original, but if the original creature was strongly biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance, if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is 3 or more levels lower. If calibrated correctly, this activation can also reverse the effect of the third activation.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact); <strong>Requirements</strong> The prism has two input streams, and a creature is encased in magic in each of the input streams; <strong>Effect</strong> Over the course of the next hour, the essences of both creatures in the input streams are refracted through the prism, creating a cocoon of magic in the output stream that contains a new creature.

The <em>philosopher's extractor</em> is designed to create the ultimate alchemical concoctions. The extractor functions as an exceptional set of alchemist's tools, granting a +4 item bonus to Crafting checks related to alchemy. When using the extractor to Craft an alchemical item or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations, you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum damage with alchemist's fire or restoring the maximum number of Hit Points with an elixir of life. If the impeccable item has a duration, it lasts twice as long as normal. Finally, an impeccable alchemical item never has a drawback.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">T</span> Interact; <strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute; <strong>Effect</strong> You use the extractor to produce an alchemical item of your level or lower whose formula you know. The extractor can create 56 levels' worth of items per day in this way. For example, the extractor could create two true elixirs of life (19th level) and two moderate elixirs of life (9th level), or eight comprehension elixirs (7th level), and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (Interact); <strong>Effect</strong> You take a sizable portion of a creature (at least two-thirds of its original mass) and filter it through the mechanisms of the extractor. After the end of the process, the philosopher's extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature's unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon's Breath Weapon, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature's DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature's physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span>Unlike normal for mutagens and effects, you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying mutagens made from different creatures, you receive abilities from each creature.
