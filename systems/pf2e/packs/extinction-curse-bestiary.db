Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Q690d3mw3TUrKX7E]{Geas}</em> on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract.

The vast majority of deepmouths worship demon lords, most commonly Zevgavizeb. Scalescribing-the warping of xulgath flesh into imitations of Abyssal script-is a widespread practice among deepmouths, enabling them to channel the power of the Abyss through their fanatical devotees' own bodies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Reptilian humanoids who live in the uppermost reaches of the Darklands, xulgaths (known as troglodytes to many surface-dwelling folk) often attack intruders in their territory on sight. They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons.

Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors' accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don't agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.</p>\n<p>Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #155: Lord of the Black Sands"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":3,"value":3}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":25}},"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["draconic","undercommon"]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["humanoid","xulgath"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"5uHVEykFkGTDN3bH","data":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[],"value":3},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[],"value":3},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[],"value":3},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[],"value":3},"slot6":{"max":9,"prepared":[],"value":9},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"ixQ2mrYzNCGW2FTE","data":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"value":"focus"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Cleric Domain Spells","sort":200000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"QVLWFDgrkjW0asVk","data":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"value":"ritual"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Rituals","sort":300000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"UF0lXsQUxywW5K2c","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":""},"areasize":{"value":""},"category":{"value":"focus"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":false,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you've recently harmed.

Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage.

When cornered, a shoony may put up a fight with whatever they have on hand; the average shoony can wield a simple shovel or pick in melee as well as most humans can wield a sword.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Shoonies are reclusive humanoids who resemble bipedal dogs with wrinkled faces and bulging eyes. They predominantly dwell in the grasslands and hilly plains of the Isle of Kortos. Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment.</p>\n<p>Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden's death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area.

Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When an urdefhan is not actively engaged in violence, their giddy cruelty is tempered only by a sense of self-preservation that ensures they survive long enough to spread the \"blessings\" of their daemonic patrons.

Among the resource-poor xulgaths who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection-magically warping and working normally inflexible stone-and the end result is an obsidian golem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons.

Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors' accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin.

Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #151: The Show Must Go On"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":6},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":9}},"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["draconic","undercommon"]},"rarity":"common","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["humanoid","xulgath"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"WnztCiLIduiohdZk","data":{"MAP":{"value":""},"baseItem":"greatpick","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"piercing","dice":1,"die":"d10","value":""},"description":{"value":"<p>This pick has a longer handle and broader head than a regular pick.

The trick, of course, is capturing and penning such a specimen. The most reliable means of caging a luminous ooze is with a permanent wall of force shaped into a cube or sphere, but few have the means to create or commission such an enclosure. Instead, most people who find themselves in possession of a luminous ooze simply put it in a thick glass box.

A few days after departing, duergar slavers attacked their caravan, murdered her father, and captured everyone else. Qormintur was sold as a slave in Shraen, and she never found out where her mother or siblings were taken. She did discover, however, that one of her father's business rivals had blackmailed her parents to leave, and the same duergar had arranged for the slavers to attack the caravan. The memories of that betrayal and the loss of her family still haunt her, and her deepest desire is to get her revenge.</p>\n<p>When she arrived in Shraen, Qormintur was first taken to the city's slave pens to be sold as a laborer, personal attendant, or fodder for one of Shraen's undead nobles. Despite the hopelessness, fear, and anxiety she witnessed in the slave pens of Shraen, her spirit never broke. When she was brought to auction, a sadistic vampire named Zihain Shraen attempted to purchase her (and likely make her one of his many playthings). The mummy Dyzallin Shraen outbid the vampire; Qormintur believes that pity or compassion caused Dyzallin to save her from a fate worse than death, but in truth, Dyzallin simply wanted to spite Zihain.</p>\n<p>During her first few years as Dyzallin's slave, the ancient drow never failed to remind Qormintur that he had saved her, and that her life was his to take if she ever disobeyed him. At first, Qormintur resented Dyzallin, but as years turned into decades, a strange bond of mutual trust formed between the soulless drow and the young duergar. In a city where trust was a commodity harder to come by than adamantine or diamonds, Dyzallin formed a bond with his servant. Dyzallin kept her close to him and encouraged her personal interests in alchemy. As a reward for her service, Dyzallin has promised to transform her into a mummy. So far, she hasn't considered the offer very seriously; after all, at barely a century old, she's young for a duergar.</p>\n<p>Appearances matter in Shraen, so despite Qormintur's trusted position, Dyzallin still makes her display her slave brands on her forearms. As Dyzallin's seneschal, Qormintur takes care of many administrative tasks for him, including buying and selling magic items and other slaves. This position has often put her into contact with the same duergar slavers who once brought ruin to her family. For now, she is forced to hide her feelings, but when the opportunity presents itself, she will not hesitate to exact her revenge. She is more than capable of doing just that-Qormintur is a potent combat alchemist and often leads Dyzallin's forces against urdefhans and other threats. Dyzallin tasked Qormintur with marshalling his forces from Shraen to the lost pyramid of Xul-Khundur, and with securing the site so Dyzallin could study the magic orb at the pyramid in peace. After Dyzallin returned to Shraen with the orb, Qormintur organized guards and has continued her master's research to unearth more of the pyramid's secrets. This research hasn't met with many results so far, and Qormintur is starting to get bored and to wonder whether she's been abandoned. Despite her loyalty to Dyzallin, Qormintur is painfully aware that she doesn't really belong in Shraen, but also that she can never return to her people. Now that she has spent time outside of Shraen and out of Dyzallin's domineering presence, a new thirst for independence is brewing inside her.</p>\n<p>Qormintur is a lean, young duergar woman who wears a fine blue cloak over beautifully crafted mithral armor. Her forearms bear sinister-looking brands that match those on her armor and cloak; these brands mark her and her equipment as property of Dyzallin.

Circus owners who mistreat their animals through harsh discipline or overtraining see little wrong with their mercilessness, even going so far as to slaughter their entertainers-supposedly \"by accident\"-via neglect or abuse.

When they can't locate their particular abuser, or if they are still unable to rest even after confronting their aggressor, visitants seek out similarly evil harmers of animals, becoming torturers of torturers. However, visitants are for the most part unable to distinguish between individual members of a species; thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage.</p>\n<p>A visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result.

In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used in its creation might retain fragments of memories or even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem with a personality and agenda of its own.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.
