Some banshees arise from elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.<br /> Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.<br /> Banshees' mere touch inflicts pain and primal fear, and those exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":17},"nethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=39","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge : DC 38","sidebarText":"<h3 class=\"title\">Born from Tragedy</h3>The banshee represents one of the most tragic of undead, a soul so wracked with agony and fury over a betrayal in life that, in death, it lingers on as a great evil.

If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it's intelligent and doesn't become a minion, the undead is helpful to you for awakening it, though it's still a horrid and evil creature. If it's unintelligent and doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command.

Unlike many oozes, which rely on camouflage and stealth to attack their prey, luminous oozes attract victims with their impressive light displays before blinding them and launching into a frenzied attack. They are often found on the ceilings or walls of dark caverns, and more than a few curious spelunkers have met their end simply by investigating their strange yet beautiful light. The effects of electricity on luminous oozes are ill understood, though those who have studied these creatures liken their static-absorbing power to that of lightning rods.<br />These creatures are highly sought after by status-hungry socialites, flamboyant barkeeps, and daring showrunners, for in addition to being dangerous monsters, luminous oozes are also incredible sources of beautiful prismatic light, comparable to a magical light show but available for a fraction of the price. The trick, of course, is capturing and penning such a specimen. The most reliable means of caging a luminous ooze is with a permanent wall of force shaped into a cube or sphere, but few have the means to create or commission such an enclosure. Instead, most people who find themselves in possession of a luminous ooze simply put it in a thick glass box. As long as they are well fed, luminous oozes accept this treatment, though woe be unto anyone in the vicinity if a hungry luminous ooze should escape from its display case.","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"},"level":{"min":1,"value":4},"nethysUrl":"http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=504","recallKnowledgeText":"Recall Knowledge  Occultism DC 19","sidebarText":"","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #151: The Show Must Go On pg. 85"}},"martial":{"advanced":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"heavy":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"light":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"martial":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"medium":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"simple":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmed":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0},"unarmored":{"breakdown":"","rank":0,"value":0}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"ability":"con","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":11},"reflex":{"ability":"dex","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":3},"will":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"rank":0,"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""}},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"arc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ath":{"ability":"str","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"cra":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dec":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"dip":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"itm":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"med":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"nat":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"occ":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"prf":{"ability":"cha","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"rel":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"soc":{"ability":"int","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"ste":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"sur":{"ability":"wis","breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0},"thi":{"ability":"dex","armor":1,"breakdown":"","item":0,"mod":0,"rank":0,"value":0}},"spells":{"spell0":{"max":0},"spell1":{"max":0},"spell10":{"max":0},"spell11":{"max":0},"spell2":{"max":0},"spell3":{"max":0},"spell4":{"max":0},"spell5":{"max":0},"spell6":{"max":0},"spell7":{"max":0},"spell8":{"max":0},"spell9":{"max":0}},"statusEffects":[],"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["critical-hits","electricity","mental","precision","unconscious","visual"]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":[]},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"senses":{"value":"motion sense 60 feet, no vision"},"size":{"value":"sm"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["mindless","ooze"]}}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.extinction-curse-bestiary.RIZDryL3Wnk6ucks"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"OkSGq1Wy2ceTrxFS","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"baseItem":null,"bonus":{"value":13},"brokenThreshold":{"value":0},"bulkCapacity":{"value":""},"collapsed":{"value":false},"containerId":{"value":""},"damage":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","die":"2d8+5"},"damageRolls":{"ycg47tcvdpt4bfe6lgw7":{"damage":"2d8+5","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":""},"equipped":{"value":false},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"hardness":{"value":0},"hp":{"value":0},"identification":{"status":"identified"},"identified":{"value":false},"invested":{"value":false},"maxHp":{"value":0},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"preciousMaterial":{"value":""},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":""},"price":{"value":0},"property1":{"critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","damageType":"","dice":0,"die":"","value":""},"property2":{"critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","damageType":"","dice":0,"die":"","value":""},"property3":{"critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","critDice":0,"critDie":"","damageType":"","dice":0,"die":"","value":""},"quantity":{"value":1},"rules":[],"size":{"value":"med"},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"stackGroup":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"weight":{"value":0}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Pseudopod","sort":100000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"hKCyP0kuF8Zoh3ey","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":""},"description":{"chat":"","unidentified":"","value":"<p>5 feet.

As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.<br /><br /> In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations-feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own
