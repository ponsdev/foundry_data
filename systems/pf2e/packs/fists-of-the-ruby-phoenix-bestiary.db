This method creates a massive amount of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by flocks of opportunistic scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who find it easy to steal bits of the larger birds' meals.

Thundering beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey-such as most humanoids-in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey.</p>\n<p>Tyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful hind legs that allow them to run quickly, and their thick tails provide them with exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim's flesh with their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long. As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous beasts with a steady diet of meat.</p>\n<p>Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs as part of executions or ritual sacrifices. Some xulgath cults even revere tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods.

Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.</p>\n<p>According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds-a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.</p>\n<p>In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.</p>\n<p>Most young anugobus undertake not just one, but many apprenticeships in order to learn advanced techniques in their trade of choice. The apprentice depicted here specializes in construction and engineering, but an anugobu is just as likely to take up cooking, hunting, tailoring, or really anything that piques their interest.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["anugobu","common","sylvan","terran"]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["anugobu","humanoid"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"p2Zc3ftvbeeGJ4aA","data":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":20,"mod":0,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Innate Occult Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"FextYGydGi4a7iJ7","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":null},"areasize":{"value":""},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect.

In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places.

Their short, stubby wings may give them a comical appearance, but anyone who's been on the receiving end of the beast's powerful beak finds the experience less than amusing. Dromornis use their beaks to easily tear flesh and sinew from prey's bones, quickly dispatching sizable mammals like deer, tapirs, and primates. Particularly hungry or aggressive dromornises have even been known to attack humanoids. The bird's strong legs sport sharp talons that, while secondary in combat to its beak, can nonetheless trample and shred smaller creatures like rodents and amphibians caught underfoot.</p>\n<p>While a lone dromornis is dangerous enough, a pack of dromornises can take down a den of bears or village of humanoids. A dromornis pack typically consists of three or four adults and up to five juveniles, all of whom work in tandem to overpower larger prey. Packs lie in wait for something like an anaconda, boar, buffalo or, in cases of desperation, a dinosaur to emerge, then move as one for a surprise strike. Dromornises aren't particularly intelligent, but they have been known to use an ingenious (if hazardous) decoy tactic, luring in massive prey by putting one of their own fledglings at risk.</p>\n<p>Dromornises most often live in tropical jungles far from the reaches of civilization, though they sometimes make their homes in mountainside caves or along rocky coastlines. While most onlookers would be hard-pressed to tell one dromornis from another, dromornises maintain tight familial structures based on pheromones and scent glands, so it's obvious when a straggler from another family is trying to encroach on a pack's den. Such disputes over breeding grounds are common; a particularly prized dromornis den might change hands several times in the course of a year. Fights between dromornis packs are chaotic and swift, marked with the sounds of terrifying screeches and sprays of blood.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":17}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":[]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"size":{"value":"lg"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["animal"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"rBUwtqIn3bI3N8vp","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":22},"damageRolls":{"f5yxmisi819tst48szj3":{"damage":"2d12+10","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d8.success]</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"Note","outcome":["success"],"selector":"{item|_id}-damage","text":"PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d8.success","visibility":"gm"},{"key":"Note","outcome":["criticalSuccess"],"selector":"{item|_id}-damage","text":"PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d8.criticalSuccess","visibility":"gm"}],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":["reach-10"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Beak","sort":100000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"BabPRyWiNWTD0pjg","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"value":[]},"bonus":{"value":20},"damageRolls":{"0ys2l5q7l4nfkfhxz0vl":{"damage":"2d8+10","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d4.success]</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"Note","outcome":["success"],"selector":"{item|_id}-damage","text":"PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d4.success","visibility":"gm"},{"key":"Note","outcome":["criticalSuccess"],"selector":"{item|_id}-damage","text":"PF2E.PersistentDamage.Bleed1d4.criticalSuccess","visibility":"gm"}],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":["agile"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Talon","sort":200000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"yoCyQ8hKhH9Vf9xB","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.LowLightVision]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"low-light-vision","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.fFu2sZz4KB01fVRc"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","sort":300000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"2ahCptrlPPU2hlfy","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Scent]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"scent","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.rqfnQ5VHT5hxm25r"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Scent (Imprecise) 30 feet","sort":400000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"FBTWvsZTjynInvCc","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Another dromornis within 10 feet Strides.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The dromornis Strides up to half its Speed.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Pack Ambush","sort":500000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"FKn1hN8LerlfFOmh","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>Dromornises fight best while among their fellows.

To the residents of Rendah Pulu, hantus exist as manifestations of their culture's anxieties, fears, and ills. An individual who encounters a hantu might interpret the meeting as a sign that they have dwelt for too long on their particular worries (or the opposite: they have ignored the source of their anxieties for too long).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, although hantus are incorporeal, they still retain tangible characteristics as varied as hantus themselves.

Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.</p>\n<p>According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds-a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.</p>\n<p>In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.</p>\n<p>Once an anugobu apprentice sets out on their own, they travel the world working on small projects here and there to maintain their skills. But an anugobu does not earn the honorable title of wondercrafter until they find their own wonder. Once they discover and finish such a wonder, the anugobu is considered fully mature. As a result of their station and experience, such anugobus possess skills and magic that far surpass most of their kind.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":13},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["anugobu","common","sylvan","terran"]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["anugobu","humanoid"]}},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"p2Zc3ftvbeeGJ4aA","data":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":25,"mod":0,"value":17},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"common","value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.769,"lastMigration":null}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Innate Occult Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"ecBm7k5M75PpelxX","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":null},"areasize":{"value":""},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.
