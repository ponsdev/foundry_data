When he's healthy again, he intends to travel north to Elturel to convey what he's learned to Ontharr Frume, a paladin of Torm who shares his concern over the Cult of the Dragon's recent surge in activity. He has a favor to ask of the characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \" ><p>\"After all you've done already for me personally and for the people of Greenest, I hate to ask anything more from you. But the need is great, and I dare to hope that you can aid me one time more. I need you to return to the cultists' camp. You know your way around it now. If the cultists are preparing to conduct another raid, or a large body of them marches away, or if anything substantial is carried into or out of that cave, I need to know. If you have a chance to get into the camp and look around again, that would be the ideal way to spot anything that's changed.</p><p>\"I don't recommend letting yourselves get captured,\" he adds with a wry smile.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters were working as caravan guards, Leosin offers to match whatever their previous employer was paying them plus 20 percent. If they are currently unemployed, he offers them 150 gp apiece. He's willing to haggle; this mission is important, and no one else is available who Leosin believes can handle it. If the characters accept, he tells them to find him at the city of Elturel afterward, both to report and to collect their pay. If he has moved on before they reach the city, they can speak to the paladin Ontharr Frume instead.</p><p>The monk doesn't believe it's essential that the characters head back to the camp immediately. He doesn't expect the cultists to make any sudden changes in their plans or mode of operation. Leosin is wrong about this, because he doesn't realize how much his presence in Greenest alarmed the wyrmspeaker. Rezmir knows that Leosin is investigating the Cult of the Dragon, but she doesn't know whether the monk's appearance in Greenest was a coincidence, a good guess, or a sign that the cult's whole plan has been compromised. She isn't willing to take chances: she's heading north with the accumulated treasure immediately.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"569\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Abandoned Camp</span></span> <p>When characters return to the camp area, they find it mostly abandoned. (If they stayed, they witnessed the rapid packing up and abandonment of the camp.) The stinking huts of the kobolds (those on level 1) have been burned, but the level 2 huts and both guard towers remain. Anyone can determine from tracks that the cultists trekked away in small groups in all directions. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 89, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) check reveals that most of the camp's wagons and pack animals moved in a train toward the west.</p><p>Still left in the camp are some hunters, the kobolds who tend the dragon nursery in the caves, Frulam Mondath, her guards, and <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#langdedrosa%20cyanwrath_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'langdedrosa%20cyanwrath_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Langdedrosa Cyanwrath</a>. Only the hunters still use the huts. All others live in the hatchery cave. The activity and guards around the cave mouth should be the top draw on the characters' attention.</p><p>On most mornings, hunters fan out onto the grassland to hunt for antelope and other large game. They travel on horseback and bring along an extra horse to pack the field-dressed game back to the camp. Hunters don't necessarily return to the camp every evening. They stay out until they have a load of meat to bring back. Hunting on the Greenfields is good, so they seldom need to spend more than a night or two away. Four @Actor[oYF9ifZwDSgy5v57]{scouts} act as hunters; roll a [[/r d4]] to determine how many are in the camp when characters arrive. They are not dedicated cultists, so they won't challenge characters who enter the camp, attack them, or even alert the cultists. They consider standing guard to be beneath them.</p><p>They are a taciturn bunch, so they won't be much help to inquisitive characters. They converse more freely with rangers, but to most strangers they merely nod, point, shake their heads, scowl, and utter one- or two-word answers. If characters converse with them, these hunters can relate how the camp dissolved within hours after the discovery of the captured half-elf's escape. Crates carried from the cave were loaded onto wagons or animals and hauled to the west. A few raiders remain in the cave: the Wearer of Purple (Mondath), the \"dragon-man\" (Cyanwrath), the better warriors, and the \"dragon-dogs\" (kobolds). As long as the cultists pay well for fresh meat, the trackers continue hunting for them. Whatever else the cave holds is none of their concern.</p><p>A thorough search of the camp takes about ten man-hours.

A successful roll means the character realizes that while quite a bit of material has been left behind, it's all trash: cracked pottery, rusty knives, soiled clothing and bedding, cheap cookware, and wine that's gone to vinegar.

The floor and three of the walls are smooth, and stalactites and stalagmites have been polished into gleaming columns. Every surface glistens with moisture, and the air is warm and humid. The flat walls of the chamber are decorated with shallow abstract carvings of dragons. Dragons' tails coil into intricate patterns and knots that flow across the walls. The creature portrayed in the northwest corner stands out: a five-headed dragon, rising from an erupting volcano. Other dragons, which seem dwarfed by the five-headed monstrosity, flock to its side. A small, wooden chest with silver and mother-of-pearl inlays sits on the floor in the corner, in front of the monstrous dragon carving.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The five-headed dragon is Tiamat, and the volcano is the Well of Dragons, where the Cult of the Dragon intends to bring Tiamat into the world. The Well of Dragons is located at the northern extreme of the Sunset Mountains. Most characters should recognize Tiamat from folktales and know she was banished to the Nine Hells long ago and remains imprisoned there. There is no way to tell from the carvings where the volcano is located, or to know if it's meant to be a prediction of events to come or just a birth metaphor for the queen of evil dragons.</p><p>The chest is locked and trapped; see \"Acid Trap\" below for details. Characters can open it with the key from area 11, or the lock can be picked with @Item[voviZoZIc1Z0e4pw]{thieves' tools} and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Unless the Dexterity roll is 15 or higher, however, it sets off the trap when the chest opens.</p><p>If characters spend 10 minutes or more studying the carvings, they can learn two things. First, black dragons are overrepresented. Almost half the dragons shown appear to be black dragons. <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rezmir_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'rezmir_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Wyrmspeaker Rezmir</a> favors them over all other types.

Within moments, the chamber is filled with acidic mist.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Everyone in the chamber must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 2d6]] acid damage from the acid sprayed onto them (half as much damage on a successful saving throw). The real danger from the acid is not to the characters' skin, however, but to their lungs. Everyone must also succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take an extra [[/r 2d8]] acid damage. Players who declare immediately that their characters are covering their faces and getting out of the chamber as quickly as possible, and are trying to not inhale the vapor, have advantage on their Constitution saving throws.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"593\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>The chest contains a few of the choicest items seized during the cult's recent treasure raids.

Inside are a string of pearls (300 gp), a gold-and-sapphire ring (900 gp), and a pouch containing a half-dozen masterfully cut and polished precious stones (100 gp each). The ring and the pearls were taken from Greenest and would be recognized by anyone from there, but the stones came from elsewhere and would be difficult to identify.

They have not hatched yet but they will very soon, which is why Rezmir was unwilling to move them when the camp packed up and left. Instead, she left them under the care of Mondath and the kobolds. The chamber is dark; the kobolds extinguished their lights when they heard fighting in area 9.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \" ><p>The chamber that opens at the bottom of the stairs is immense.

Wooden steps have been built down to the lower floor. As in room 7, the steps are enclosed in a stout iron cage with a gate at the bottom.

As soon as characters advance into the room as far as the top of the stairs, they come under attack from the kobolds hiding in 10B. See that description for details.</p><p>From the ledge, characters can just make out the shapes of large eggs (each egg is nearly three feet tall) in the darkness below. The cavern extends into darkness beyond the range of their light. They need to go down the stairs and explore the area directly to discover its full extent.

They don't attack as soon as characters come through the gate but wait until the characters have moved into the chamber. The drakes' first priority is to protect the eggs. Their second priority is to get between the intruders and the steps to prevent them from escaping. Unless characters climb down into 10A without using the stairs, they trigger the kobolds' attack before exploring this area.</p><p>Mixed in among the stalactites near the southeast corner of the room is an unusual @Actor[hF4ydhQkBCw5IXwN]{roper} that can speak Common. It doesn't attack the kobolds or guard drakes because the kobolds feed it spoiled meat that the guard drakes won't eat. If attacked, it fights back (and it's very dangerous to 3rd-level characters!). It can reach anywhere in area 10 with its tentacles, and it can also move at speed 10. It is currently full and curious about strangers, however, so it's not averse to talking. Its only real concern is food. If told about the supply of meat in area 6 and brought some as proof, It leaves the characters along while it creeps away to investigate the larder.</p><p>A total of three dragon eggs are spread throughout the area. Each is about three feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Two of them are easy to spot just by walking through the room with a light source.

The dragons can be killed easily if the eggs are smashed, crushed, or stabbed. If an egg is simply cracked open, the infant dragon struggles for breath, cries and squirms like a human baby for a few minutes, and then dies.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"596\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">10B.

A separate sheet of paper that is covered with numerals in columns contains the note, \"Everything must be freighted north to Naerytar.

With this regalia, one person (preferably a human woman, but the clothing can be adjusted to fit a man) can be outfitted as a Wearer of Purple. It's worth noting that each Wearer of Purple's regalia is similar but unique, so high-ranking cult members are likely to recognize this regalia as Mondath's.

Mondath knows that the Cult is amassing treasure in the north and that Rezmir spoke often of Tiamat, but that is the extent of her knowledge of the larger plan.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"601\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">12. Guard Barracks</span></span> <p>The guards who remained behind with Mondath use this chamber as their barracks. They maintain a two-person watch at the entrance (area 1); two dragonclaws are currently on duty in that area, and the others—three @Actor[oIZsknvqHKDlUmAn]{guards} and eight @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists}—are here, asleep or relaxing. If fighting against the dragonclaws from area 1 pushes near the passage to area 12, roll a [[/r d20]]; the guards here investigate the sound on a roll of 12 or higher. Otherwise they stay here, mostly oblivious to what's going on elsewhere.</p><p>If characters enter this chamber from area 2, the guards react quickly. Two of the guards and five of the cultists fight the characters here while one guard and three of the cultists retreat to area 11 to protect Frulam Mondath.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"602\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>The guards' scabbards are decorated with dragon motifs. They are worth about 5 gp each. They are not part of a Cult of the Dragon \"uniform,\" but wearing one of these scabbards could buy a character credibility when trying to pose as a cultist. For example, you might grant a +1 bonus to Charisma checks made to fool or influence cultists. Aside from their gear, the guards have coins and small gems worth a total of 120 gp.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"603\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">13. Treasure Storage</span></span> <p>This chamber is now mostly empty, except for a few overturned boxes, broken items, scattered coins, small gems that were dropped during the hasty evacuation, and one @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultist} who is sleeping soundly on the floor after consuming several bottles of wine. He won't wake up from anything less than vigorous shaking, and it will be several hours before he is coherent. All the dropped items left in this room have a total value of only 16 gp.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"604\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rewards</span></span> <p>Award standard XP for defeated foes.

They have at least a full day's head start on the characters, and possibly more, depending on how much time characters spent in Greenest before returning to the plateau.</p></div></div></div>","_id":"4z6EU9YZI8n4GjSd"}
{"_id":"6fzgxC5Ze0hNtZg4","name":"The Environment","permission":{"default":0,"fNZMR0wRZYko05MN":3},"folder":"z12TjRRwJKqBE135","sort":300001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.</p>\n<h2>Falling</h2>\n<p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>\n<h2>Suffocating</h2>\n<p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p>\n<p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h2>Vision and Light</h2>\n<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring&mdash; noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few&mdash;rely heavily on a character&rsquo;s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>\n<p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>\n<p>A <strong>heavily obscured </strong>area&mdash;such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage&mdash;blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.995mfaI3z7WtY7vK]{blinded} condition when trying to see something in that area.</p>\n<p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Bright light </strong>lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p>\n<h3>Blindsight</h3>\n<p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p>\n<h3>Darkvision</h3>\n<p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<h3>Truesight</h3>\n<p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.hMWCeXenROGuhF1K]{invisible} creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<h2>Food and Water</h2>\n<p>Characters who don&rsquo;t eat or drink suffer the effects of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.apBZudO4UA1wj7aC]{exhaustion}. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can&rsquo;t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>\n<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p>\n<h3>Water</h3>\n<p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p>\n<h2>Interacting with Objects</h2>\n<p>A character&rsquo;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.</p>\n<p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>\n<p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object&rsquo;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It&rsquo;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>\n<p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>"}
{"name":"Actions in Combat","permission":{"default":0,"fNZMR0wRZYko05MN":3},"folder":"z12TjRRwJKqBE135","sort":500001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p>\n<p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<h2>Attack</h2>\n<p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p>\n<p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.pJW6Xqjdk8nzrYd3]{Making an Attack} section for the rules that govern attacks.</p>\n<p>Certain features, such as the @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.q9g1MLXuLZyxjQMg]{Extra Attack} feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p>\n<h2>Cast a Spell</h2>\n<p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</p>\n<h2>Dash</h2>\n<p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p>\n<p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p>\n<h2>Disengage</h2>\n<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn&rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>\n<h2>Dodge</h2>\n<p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.tUYvSkhggFcMpVw5]{incapacitated} (as explained in @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.lrgT2KMBGTgZD4sA]{appendix PH-A}) or if your speed drops to 0.</p>\n<h2>Help</h2>\n<p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally&rsquo;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p>\n<h2>Hide</h2>\n<p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.pJW6Xqjdk8nzrYd3]{Unseen Attackers and Targets} section.</p>\n<h2>Ready</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &ldquo;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I&rsquo;ll pull the lever that opens it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>\n<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell&rsquo;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{Web} spell and ready @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic Missile}, your Web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release Magic Missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>\n<h2>Search</h2>\n<p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<h2>Use an Object</h2>\n<p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>","_id":"FoCT1e8fFPldkVOa"}

This gallery explores some of the behind-the-scenes development that went into creating <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i>, as well as defining a spectrum of monsters, allies, and enemies that would feature in Dungeons & Dragons offerings for years to come.</p><p>On the following pages, you'll find a number of images designed to serve as story beats in the larger <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> campaign. These images were created to define impactful moments in a hypothetical <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> tale, one which then could be explored by multiple teams over the course of multiple projects—be they games, fiction, or otherwise. Some elements you'll recognize from the events of the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> adventures, while others were meant to provide inspiration for events parallel stories could detail.</p><p>Beyond these, this gallery also includes a number of designs focused on threats integral to the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> campaign. This includes explorations of well-known Forgotten Realms villains, like the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay. The images herein show just a few avenues explored in updating these foes to the most current edition of the game, along with notes taken from internal concept and story documents. Some present ideas never fully expressed in <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i>, while others reveal deeper depths to adventure elements hiding whole conceptual icebergs. Certain components central to the adventure also see extensive exploration, like the garb of the Red Wizards, the iconography of the Cult of the Dragon, and—of course—the multiple deadly aspects of one of the campaign's central magic items, the @Item[M92JalgNBT7dBh5B]{Mask of the Dragon Queen}.</p><p>Several other locations and characters also feature prominently in this collection, many being aspects of the Forgotten Realms or underpinning the wider D&D multiverse that have seen artistic evolutions over the years. The thorough design sketches of chromatic dragons, for example, hint at the depth of ecological detail that's gone into realizing D&D's most iconic monsters—and foes central to the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> plot.</p><p>How you choose to use this concept gallery is up to you. Perhaps these details will inspire you, just as they did the original <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> designers. Maybe a particular image will resound with you, leading you to make your own addition to the wider campaign. Added insights on the tools and techniques of the adventure's villains can help you make them feel like more vital inhabitants of a wider world, while nuances of dragons and other can creatures aid in bringing these terrors to life. These pages might also be shared with players as you see fit, driving home the impact of the campaign's most climatic moments. Whether this gallery serves as a game aide or inspires your own designs, use it as you please, further detailing the existing adventures or exploring <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> stories yet to be told!</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"960\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Invasion of Icewind

The change in climate is very stark; the portal and a nearby lodge are buffeted by chill winds, and the surrounding countryside is heavily forested. The portal is one of several that predate the Cult of the Dragon, and it helps the cult leaders gather over large distances.</p><p>Next to the portal is a hunting lodge used by a succession of local lords over the years. The lodge is a useful and central meeting place for high-ranking cultists, among them a Wearer of Purple known as Talis the White.</p><p>Talis feels strongly that she belongs in Severin's \"inner circle,\" but Severin doesn't trust her and recently appointed a dwarf named Varram as his wyrmspeaker in charge of recovering the @Item[GcAI2ML9B03M1RB8]{White Dragon Mask}. The adventurers meet Talis and her servants, and they could end up fighting Talis and her crew in the lodge. They might also bargain and make a deal with Talis, striking against those who oppose her ascension. If they do the latter, she helps the party reach the nearby village of Parnast and aboard Skyreach Castle (see chapter 8)—but negotiations are fairly hazardous and might easily result in combat rather than a deal.</p><p>If the players don't realize that the cult hopes to bring Tiamat to the Realms, this chapter is the best time for that information to be revealed or confirmed. Although Talis won't mention any details such as masks or summonings, the cultists share a general belief that the time is right for Tiamat's arrival. The characters can find several clues that encourage this belief.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"786\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">General Features</span></span> <p>The lodge is built in a comfortable but rustic style, and good tapestries and some hunting trophies festoon its rooms.

He's very devoted to Talis, and he serves the Cult of the Dragon enthusiastically. His four arms just make it easier to claw, rip, and shred anything too slow to escape his reach.

The trade caravans that pass through Greenest bring gold to the town's merchants and craftsfolk, and Governor Nighthill runs the town at the behest of the inhabitants.</p><p>The adventurers might be on the road from one town to another or returning to their homes after a trip away.

Through diligent research and interviews conducted during his travels between Berdusk and Candlekeep, Leosin became convinced that the cult is engaged in a big operation, but he doesn't yet know what it is. Leosin uses the raid as an opportunity to infiltrate the cult so that he can learn more about the cult's plans.

Linan is a @Actor[vdl3m1fbQUohhAjy]{commoner} but with 8 hit points. Her attack with the spear is +2 to hit for [[/r 1d6]] piercing damage. Her husband is down to 2 hit points from an earlier fight. The children move at speed 20. They can be carried, but a character carrying a child has disadvantage on attack rolls and cannot wield a two-handed weapon.</p><p>Unless characters interfere, the kobolds assume the characters are cultists and ignore them. Assuming characters intervene and save the family, Linan explains that they must make their way to the keep (at area 1); it's the only safe place in Greenest. The raiders haven't set up an effective cordon around the keep, so it's still possible to move through the front gate—but not for long.</p><p>To reach the keep, the characters must make it past three groups of raiders. A group consists of [[/r 1d6]] @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds} and [[/r 1d4]] @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists}. If the group contains six kobolds, one is a @Actor[Rd2OneK8bByJKVR3]{winged kobold (urd)}.</p><p>Characters can fight these enemies, sneak past them, retreat to avoid them entirely, or try something clever such as bluffing. If they fight, run the combat normally. When enemies must make a check to notice sneaking or bluffing, make a check with advantage for the group.</p><p>Each time the characters retreat from an enemy group to avoid it, they run into [[/r 1d6]] more townsfolk who are trying to reach the keep. For every four additional townsfolk in tow, the group must move past one more enemy group to reach the keep.</p><p>At the keep, the characters are the last group through the gate before it is closed and barred.

Time during the hour that isn't spent fighting or slipping through town is spent tending gear, bandaging minor wounds, patrolling the keep's walls, briefing Nighthill on the situation, and other mundane tasks. If characters take a short rest, they can't undertake any other mission that hour.</p><p>If players need guidance, Governor Nighthill can give the characters a quick briefing on the tactical situation. The raiders have isolated the keep from the town with encircling groups of guards, but they haven't organized an attack. Nighthill thinks the raiders don't intend to attack the keep; they seem interested only in loot. The real danger is to the town and to those people who didn't make it into the keep before it was cut off. Nighthill wants the characters to slip back into the town and help people who are cut off or harass the raiders. A stealthy group can make it out of the keep and back in again without drawing the raiders' attention.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"527\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Old Tunnel</span></span> <p>A narrow tunnel runs from the cellar beneath the keep to the bank of the stream (area 2). The tunnel is wide enough to allow warriors to pass through it in single file. In the keep, the tunnel is sealed with a locked ironbound door, and the stream exit is covered with a locked iron grate made to look like a sewer outlet. The tunnel's main function was as a secret means of collecting water from the stream during a siege, but it can double as a sally port. Since the keep has never been besieged, the old tunnel has never been used. Barrels and crates are piled in front of the door. The keys for the locks are on the ring that Escobert carries with him everywhere.</p><p>At some point, Escobert recommends the tunnel as a means of sneaking townsfolk into the keep without running the gauntlet of attackers watching the gates.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"528\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Locks</span></span> <p>Characters can clear the cellar door with a few minutes' work. The lock is stiff but opens with the key; without the key, the character can open the lock with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of @Item[voviZoZIc1Z0e4pw]{thieves' tools}. The disused tunnel is choked with webs but is otherwise clear. A few yards inside the stream end is a nest of two @Actor[huJjsAmsOFsTGHzX]{swarms of rats}. The rats attack when disturbed, and the surviving rats flee when half their number die.</p><p>Years of exposure and neglect have corroded the lock on the exit grate. Even with the key, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check is needed to open the lock. Without the key, the DC increases to 20. If the roll misses by 5 or more, the key or @Item[voviZoZIc1Z0e4pw]{thieves' tools} break off in the lock so that unlocking it becomes impossible. Then only a successful DC 15 Strength check can force the grate open.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"529\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Foes</span></span> <p>A group of cultists is searching the stream banks for hiding townsfolk when the characters emerge from the tunnel. If characters open the lock with the key or with @Item[voviZoZIc1Z0e4pw]{thieves' tools}, the first one to exit notices the raiders approaching without being spotted in return; the characters can keep out of sight in the tunnel or try to ambush the raiders after they pass. If the check fails, the raiders spot the character; roll initiative and proceed with combat. If the grate had to be broken open with a Strength check, the raiders hear the noise and find cover; they wait for the characters to exit the tunnel, then gain a surprise round. The raiders' group consists of two @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists} and six @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds}. If any cultists are still alive at the beginning of the fourth round of the fight, one of them runs to fetch help. Ten minutes later, two @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists}, ten @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds}, and one <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ambush%20drake_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'ambush%20drake_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >ambush drake</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>) arrive to guard the tunnel.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"530\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rewards</span></span> <p>Award standard XP for defeated foes. Aside from that, the chief reward for this mission is the tunnel itself. As long as it remains secret, characters can use it to enter and exit the keep safely. Each time they use the tunnel exit, roll a [[/r d6]]. On a 1, raiders see and attack the characters (use the Chapter 1 Encounters table). On a 2, they are seen but not attacked. Instead, the raiders set an ambush and attack the next time the characters return to the tunnel exit.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"531\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Sally Port</span></span> <p>The keep has a sally port along the west wall for counterattacking foes who bring a battering ram against the gates. During the night while characters are in the keep, raiders approach the old gate, force it open, and rush through. Escobert discovers them and races into the courtyard to sound the alarm ahead of the infiltrators.</p><p>Enough defenders are available to deal with the immediate threat from raiders loose in the keep, since it's more a probe that got out of hand rather than a full-scale assault. Escobert is most concerned about resealing the sally port, and he seeks out the characters for that job.</p><p>To secure the sally port, characters must battle through two groups of foes. The first fight occurs against three @Actor[YjBWOo5gbZNsBCMF]{acolytes}, three @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds}, and one <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ambush%20drake_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'ambush%20drake_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >ambush drake</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>), which are guarding the sally port's 10-foot-by-20-foot ready room against exactly this type of counterattack. After characters seize the room, they discover that the door is heavily damaged. The fastest repair is with five castings of @Item[BCHKWtxLNiiMhyJi]{mending} (taking five minutes). If none of the characters can do this, an NPC in the keep knows the cantrip. Someone must find and fetch her to the ready room.</p><p>Before the door can be repaired, a second group of raiders consisting of two @Actor[oIZsknvqHKDlUmAn]{guards}, three @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists}, and three @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds} attacks. These foes can come from outside the keep, or they might be a group of infiltrators trying to fight its way back outside. If characters barricade the door with barrels or other heavy objects while awaiting repairs, they might hold off attackers until the repairs are finished and avoid this fight entirely.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"532\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rewards</span></span> <p>Award standard XP for defeated foes.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"533\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dragon Attack</span></span> <p>The @Actor[dL5LvxTlT4cN6Sle]{adult blue dragon} Lennithon accompanied this raid but is not an enthusiastic participant. Its chief contribution has been its Frightful Presence, but that becomes less effective as the night wears on and defenders overcome their fear. Shortly before midnight, the dragon launches a final assault against the citadel. Frulam Mondath orders the attack, knowing that the adventurers are in the keep at the time. Lennithon doesn't consider this to be its fight, and it isn't keen on tangling with adventurers for another's benefit.</p><p>During this attack, Lennithon flies over the keep and uses his breath weapon without moving closer than 25 feet from the parapet. The defenders on the walls have mastered their fear of the dragon's Frightful Presence from earlier attacks. There are twenty NPC defenders on the walls at the beginning of the mission, and more can arrive between attacks to take the place of those who fall. The dragon doesn't target the adventures at first, and every breath attack not directed at them kills [[/r 1d4]] NPC defenders and injures [[/r 1d6]] more. Adventurers who happen to get caught in the area make normal saving throws and take standard damage. The NPCs' attacks are ineffective against Lennithon. Bear in mind that the dragon's breath weapon will kill a 1st-level character outright, so be sure to demonstrate its destructive power to the players before turning the dragon against the party.</p><p>After each attack, Lennithon swoops away until his breath weapon recharges, then swings in for another attack. He repeats this pattern until it has taken 24 damage or more, or a single critical hit. After that happens, Lennithon leaves for good.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"534\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rewards</span></span> <p>Characters earn 50 XP each for driving away Lennithon, but reduce that award to 25 XP if 10 or more defenders were killed during the attack.

Mondath has been informed that heroes are aiding the town, and she wants to lure them into an ambush. More raiders—one @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultist} and one @Actor[oIZsknvqHKDlUmAn]{guard} per character—are hiding inside the mill, waiting for the characters to show up.</p><p>The mill is a simple rectangular barn, about 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, with an attached, exterior office. The long side of the building away from the stream has barn doors and a two-part door, and the two short walls have windows. All these openings are closed, but none are locked or barred. Inside, the main floor is dominated by a massive stone grinding wheel driven by a water wheel in the stream. The mill was operating late when the raid began and the millers fled without disengaging the wheel, so it still turns noisily. The upper half of the barn is a loft where milled flour is stored. The loft can be reached by wooden stairs along the east wall or by using the ropes and pulleys that hoist bags of flour up and down through large openings in the loft floor.</p><p>The ambushers are waiting in the loft for heroes to enter the mill.

The attackers tried setting fire to the stout structure but had little success. Now they've deployed an improvised battering ram. It's only a matter of time, possibly minutes, before the temple's main doors crumple under the assault, leaving the people inside helpless.</p><p>The temple is a large building, made of fieldstone with a peaked slate roof, and square in shape. It is taller than most other buildings in town. Inside, the altar occupies the middle of the temple, with other worship areas arranged around it.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"540\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Foes</span></span> <p>The force outside the temple is split into three groups. One (A) is battering at the front doors, another (B) is circling the temple in a screeching mob, and the third (C) is heaping burning straw against a rear door. All these groups together would overwhelm 1st-level characters, but characters can devise a plan that gets them inside the temple by dealing with one group.</p><p>Group A consists of one <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dragonclaw_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'dragonclaw_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >dragonclaw</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>), two @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists}, and six @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds}. The cultists are handling the ram while the kobolds stand guard in case the town militia mounts a counterattack. The dragonclaw is in charge. The kobold guards are alert, but they are distracted when Group B passes in front of the temple.</p><p>Group B consists of three @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists}, ten @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds}, and two <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ambush%20drake_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'ambush%20drake_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >ambush drakes</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>) strung out in a mob that stretches 50 feet.

Their meager fire produces little flame, instead creating prodigious clouds of thick smoke that engulf the back of the temple and blanket the surrounding 30 feet of ground. Everything in the smoke is lightly obscured, and objects or creatures that are seen through more than 15 feet of smoke are heavily obscured. Characters can sneak up on these raiders and gain a surprise round against them, as long as they avoid Group B in the process.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"541\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arranging a Rescue</span></span> <p>The heroes' best shot at rescuing the townsfolk is to overpower Group C and take control of the back door. In the temple, they can arrange a distraction to keep Groups A and B occupied at the front while the citizens of Greenest slip out the back and race for the keep or for the old tunnel—if characters have opened it already. That's only one possibility; clever players can come up with different solutions.</p><p>The townsfolk in the temple are near panic, however, and they won't take orders from strangers unless someone makes a successful DC 15 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 75, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Persuasion</span>) check. Otherwise, characters need to locate the priest of Chauntea, Eadyan Falconmoon, a level-headed half-elf. He's easy to spot, being the only calm person they can find in the temple, and he is elated to see them. He looks to the characters for a plan.</p><p>Time is pressing. While characters are inside the temple, remind them of the booming blows of the battering ram against the front doors and the frightened townsfolk. How much time you allow before the doors burst open depends on your group. What's important is that players feel pressed. To create a sense of pressure, give the front doors 30 hit points and let each thud of the battering ram deal [[/r 1d6]] bludgeoning damage. When the doors reach 20 hit points, they have cracks large enough to see through. At 10 hit points, the doors sag in their hinges. At 5, they could collapse at the next impact. How frequently you roll the die is up to you! One roll every 15–20 seconds is a good target for an average group. Be flexible, judge the players' level of tension, and don't let anyone relax.</p><p>If the doors burst open before the temple is evacuated, this scene turns into an ugly melee against Group A. The kobolds in that group prefer to attack unarmed villagers instead of lethal adventurers. Each kobold automatically kills one villager each round unless characters attack the kobolds, cut them off from their victims, or interfere some other way. If townsfolk have already evacuated the temple through the back door, or that process is well along before the front doors split apart under the ram, then characters can conduct a fighting withdrawal through the temple. After everyone gets into the smoke outside, they can close and brace the back door, then sprint for the keep or the tunnel in the stream bank with enough of a head start to get away safely.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"542\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rewards</span></span> <p>Rescuing people from the temple earns each character 100 XP in addition to the points for killing monsters.

He agrees to these terms for the combat: The three children will be set loose immediately, but his kobolds will continue to stand guard over the woman, and they will kill her if anyone interferes in the fight—for example, if archers in the keep let fly at him. Regardless of who wins, the woman will be released when the fight is over; and the victor will be the last one standing.</p><p>Governor Nighthill holds his troops in the keep during the combat. Adventurers can go out if they want, but the half-dragon insists that they keep their distance and stay between him and the fortress. If characters try to surround him or to edge into position for an ambush, he warns them that his kobolds won't hesitate to kill the hostages if they see signs of treachery. The half-dragon is evil, but he has a deep sense of honor about one-on-one combat. He doesn't intend any shenanigans, and he won't allow any from his kobolds.</p><p>Cyanwrath is the likely winner of this match, whether he's fighting Sergeant Markguth or a character. When his foe drops, he strikes one more time; the last blow kills Markguth or inflicts one death roll failure on a character. If Cyanwrath loses the fight, the kobolds immediately jump in to protect his body and carry it away. (Cyanwrath will recover from his wounds and be encountered again later.)

Rezmir doesn't expect a serious challenge from the town, and slower members of the raiding party and walking wounded straggle into camp all through the day after the raid. The situation at the camp is confused and security is lax. Most of these raiders are mercenaries and bandits, and not even the dedicated cultists wear recognizable uniforms on raids. No one challenges latecomers for passwords or security signals. Put simply, the raiders are confident that no enemies followed them this far. Characters can walk straight into the camp without having their identities seriously challenged. In fact, the bolder they are, the more likely they are to blend right in.</p><p>Players may be tempted to have characters seek cover and observe during the day and not attempt to enter the camp until nightfall. This can work, too, but sneaking around in the dark is more likely to attract suspicion than simply walking in as if they belong in the camp.</p><p>The chief risk is that someone might recognize the characters from the fighting at Greenest. Have each character make a DC 5 Charisma check. Success means no one remembers the character's face, but failure means that at some time (not necessarily immediately, but when recognition would be the most dramatic), someone in the camp recognizes the character. If characters are wearing Cult of the Dragon regalia taken from the rearguard, the characters have disadvantage on this roll because no one returning to camp at this time should be in uniform. The character who faced Cyanwrath one-on-one, however, has a -4 penalty to the roll. If that character ever comes face-to-face with the half-dragon, recognition is automatic.</p><p>As the day wears on and the commotion winds down, the camp becomes calmer and better organized. Guards resume their normal routines. If characters haven't entered the camp before sundown of the first day, they find it more difficult, since there's very little traffic in and out of the camp on a normal day. They'll need a good story and a successful DC 10 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 87, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Deception</span>) check to walk past a guard station of five @Actor[oIZsknvqHKDlUmAn]{guards}. This check can be made only once for the group; they can't talk their way out of a failure. After the initial opportunity to enter the camp has passed, characters need to resort to stealth or subterfuge to get in. For example, characters scaling the plateau from the east could use brush for cover right up to where the cliff overlooks the camp. From there, they could observe or climb down the rocks under cover of darkness.</p><p>The whole camp goes on alert if the bodies of murdered human sentries or cultists are discovered. One dead kobold won't cause much alarm, but many dead kobolds will. If the camp goes on alert, every character must make a DC 15 Charisma check. A failure means the character has been spotted as a stranger and an infiltrator. Someone raises the hue and cry, which quickly draws a crowd. A roll of 10 or lower means someone has recognized the character from the fight in Greenest. The characters have a chance to get away if they immediately go on the attack and begin cutting their way out of camp, but if they delay or spin tales, a crowd of @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists} that outnumbers them five to one surrounds them.</p><p>If characters try to estimate numbers in the camp, they count roughly one hundred kobolds and a mix of bandits, guards, and cultists totaling about eighty—effectively an unlimited supply if characters get the idea of fighting them all.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"564\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Captured!</span></span> <p>If caught, characters are disarmed, their hands are tied, and they are brought before Frulam Mondath for judgment.

Mondath sentences all of them to be executed on the morrow, after spending the night tied to posts alongside the monk Leosin. Characters have one night to escape this fate. They might wriggle out of their bonds, bribe or charm a cultist to set them free, or come up with a clever use for a cantrip. If all else fails, Leosin reveals that he has a hidden knife with which they can cut themselves free.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If characters admit they came from Greenest and are enemies of the cult, the effect is the same as if they'd been recognized.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If characters lie to Mondath—claiming they are new recruits and this is all a mistake, for example, or that they are studying the cult before deciding whether to join—then compare their Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 88, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Deception</span>) checks to Mondath's Wisdom check to determine whether she believes them.

Those who Mondath does not believe are sentenced to die as above.</li></ul></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"565\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Exploring the Camp</span></span> <p>Characters can learn much from poking around in the camp. If the characters pose as cult members, they can speak to other cultists and question them (carefully) about the cult's plans and long-term goals.

Kobolds are less helpful and should be considered hostile when characters make Charisma checks to gauge their reaction.</p><p>Characters can learn the following information through observation and questioning. They need to be careful, however, not to attract attention for asking too many questions or poking their noses into things that are none of their business.

Leosin had studied their previous attacks and concluded that the time was right for the cult to strike a bigger target, and he knew that Greenest was prosperous yet poorly defended, making it the most likely next target. So, when he deemed the time was just about right, he visited the town with the intent of staying until something happened. His observations paid off, and Leosin separated from his people during the night and fell in with the raiders when they retreated, hoping to learn more about the cult's plans and the location of their camp. Rezmir spotted him after the sun came up, and the monk was quickly overpowered and captured.</p><p>That portion of Leosin's scheme has worked reasonably well. He now knows most of the information listed above under \"Exploring the Camp.\" Unfortunately for him, captivity has been more brutal than he expected, and although his mind and will are still strong, he's in a very poor physical state.</p><p>Despite the danger, Leosin isn't entirely happy about being rescued if characters come to set him free. He believes he can learn more, and he's willing to take the risk. He's too weak to resist, however, so characters can easily take him away against his will if that's what they want to do. He can move without aid at a speed of 20 feet and fights as a commoner with disadvantage on attack rolls. If characters don't bring him out of the camp, Leosin breaks away on his own. He refuses to talk about it later.</p><p>If characters are captured and imprisoned alongside Leosin and their attempts to escape fall through, he reveals that he has a small knife hidden in his boot. They can use it to cut their bonds. Leosin's absence is noticed within five minutes if he is taken away, and an alarm goes up throughout the camp. Rigging up a dummy in his place delays the discovery by twenty minutes.

A fortified roadhouse that once served merchants and teamsters now feeds laborers and safeguards road-building supplies, and it also aids the Cult of the Dragon in smuggling its treasure.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"656\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Waterdeep</span></span> <p>When the caravan rolls into Waterdeep after two months on the road, most of the merchants disperse to the city's markets, warehouses, and stables. They've reached their destination and the characters are paid off in silver and thanked for their service. If they performed well, they're told they can find work with these shippers any time in the future. Characters can't waste much time closing accounts with their own employers or sightseeing in Waterdeep, however, or they lose the treasure wagons in the crowded metropolis.</p><p>The cult wagons don't follow the same pattern as the others from the caravan. Instead, they head for the north side of the city before looking for a place to spend the night. Everyone who the characters know to be associated with the cult gathers at the same spot by nightfall. Azbara Jos remains with the cultists during this time, and Jamna expresses her desire to stick with them until they uncover the treasure's destination.</p><p>The cultists spend a day resting their horses at a stable on the north side of Waterdeep. Other wagons are already there, covertly carrying treasure from all over the Sword Coast to the collection point. During the day, some of the cultists visit a large warehouse just inside the northern city gate, where construction supplies are stockpiled for shipment north and where wagons are gathered and loaded for the trip.</p><p>If characters ask around Waterdeep's northern gate about anyone matching Rezmir's description, they hear rumors of a half-dragon being sighted in the area at least a tenday ago. Everyone remembers the incident; chromatic half-dragons are almost never seen, and they tend to cause alarm when they are. If the rumor is true, then the half-dragon was traveling with a strong escort of mounted guards, headed north. The rumor is true, of course, but it can't be confirmed 100 percent.</p><p>By asking around, characters learn that the road to the north, called the High Road, used to connect Waterdeep to the city of Neverwinter. A cold, coastal marsh called the Mere of Dead Men lay between the road and the coast. Over the years, the mere continually expanded. Each time it grew, it flooded the road, which had to be relocated farther inland. That was the situation until a century ago, when Neverwinter was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow. With the city in ruins, efforts to keep the road open simply stopped. It no longer served a purpose.</p><p>But now, Lord Neverember is rebuilding Neverwinter and the road is needed again. The warehouse visited by the cultists is where shipments of supplies to the road-building camps are coordinated. If freight haulers went there, it must have been to see if they could haul supplies to the road-head for pay. Are they hiring guards for supply caravans? Sure, you bet they are. The Mere of Dead Men is wild and dangerous. Lord Neverember's agents in this endeavor are perpetually looking for laborers to build the road and fighters to protect the laborers. Turnover in those jobs is pretty high.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"657\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Northbound, Again</span></span> <p>The characters have no trouble getting hired as wagon escorts at the supply warehouse. Unlike in the caravan, guards are not hired by individual wagon masters but by the High Road Charter Company, a consortium of guilds and noble houses partnered with Lord Neverember. A human @Actor[Mf2RkpVn2hL4aKfI]{veteran} named Ardred Briferhew commands the entire convoy. It consists of six supply wagons, twelve escorts (including the characters and Jamna), and two dozen laborers marching out to relieve a group that is coming back to Waterdeep for some time off. Those cultists who weren't hired as teamsters for their three wagons are coming along as laborers.</p><p>The cultists are not happy to see the characters again, so the characters are the target of dirty looks.</p><p>The work camp the convoy is headed toward lies 200 miles up the coast. For most of that distance, the road winds through rough coastal hills nestled between the Sword Mountains and the sea. On the seventh night, the convoy camps on a hilltop from which characters have their first sight of the Mere of Dead Men. It is a chill tangle of trees, brush, boggy ground, standing water, reeds, and cat-tails stretching farther than the eye can see. The rest of the trip is within sight of the mere. The destination is reached sometime on the tenth day.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"658\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Encounters North of Waterdeep</span></span> <p>Nothing much needs to happen on the trip north of Waterdeep.

It fell into disuse when trade stopped, but now that the road is being rebuilt, the roadhouse has been repaired and put to use as a supply depot and wagon park. This part of the adventure plays like a spy story. Stealthy characters should find plenty to do here.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"661\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Essential Ingredients</span></span> <p>The work camp is exactly what it appears to be: a supply depot for the road builders. It is also something more, however: a transit point for the cult's contraband coming up from the south.</p><p>When wagons arrive from the south, they are brought into the compound one or two at a time for unloading, then moved back outside for parking. The compound is crowded with food, lumber, and myriad other supplies in crates and barrels. Material that can't be left exposed to the cold, wet weather or is especially valuable is stored in the warehouse (area 3), and anything valuable is kept in the locked strong room attached to the warehouse (area 4). Only the camp superintendent, a burly half-orc known only as Bog Luck (use @Actor[Mf2RkpVn2hL4aKfI]{veteran} statistics), has a key to that inner room.</p><p>Bog Luck was recruited to the Cult of the Dragon years ago. The only outward sign of this is the scabbard of his ever-present shortsword, which is decorated with a dragon resembling the designs on the scabbards characters saw in the dragon hatchery (and possibly have with them still; see area 12 in that section). When cult wagons arrive, their road-building cargo is unloaded into the compound normally, but Bog Luck ensures that the contraband is stored in the strong room. Afterward, he goes into the strong room alone and paints a symbol onto each carton belonging to the cult.</p><p>In the floor of the strong room is a camouflaged trapdoor. It can be found with a DC 10 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 123, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) check. The trapdoor connects to a dripping, slimy tunnel that runs 500 yards into a dense stand of trees and brush at the edge of the Mere of Dead Men. At night, when everyone in the compound is asleep except for a few rooftop guards, lizardfolk creep through the tunnel and take the marked crates to a location in the mere (the subject of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,6\"   >chapter 6</a>). They seldom perform this task over a single night unless the shipment is very small. Typically they take one night per wagon.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/025-map-5-1-carnath-roadhouse.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Map 5.1: Carnath Roadhouse\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/025-map-5-1-carnath-roadhouse.jpg\" alt=\"Map 5.1: Carnath Roadhouse\"  >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Map 5.1: Carnath Roadhouse</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/026-map-5-1-carnath-roadhouse-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"(Player Version)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/026-map-5-1-carnath-roadhouse-player.jpg\" alt=\"(Player Version)\"  >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">(Player Version)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"662\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">1. Courtyard</span></span> <p>Most of the time, this open courtyard is crowded with crates, barrels, and stacks of supplies. The damp climate means that the ground is muddy, except when the temperature is below freezing. Then the mud hardens into uneven, frost-covered ruts. A path is kept clear from the gate to the stables so animals can be moved, but during busy times, that path often runs under the balcony in front of the doors to the rooms.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"663\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">2.

Four stable boys take care of the animals and sleep here. Only the youngest, a quick-witted boy called Wump, has any suspicion that something mysterious is going on. He knows nothing about the Cult of the Dragon, but he's sharp enough to wonder why anything used by the road builders needs to be locked up.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"664\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">3.

Strong Room</span></span> <p>Unusually valuable cargoes and personal items are kept in the strong room under lock and key. None of the workers know or care what sorts of road-building supplies are considered so valuable they must be locked up for protection. They just follow Bog Luck's instructions and stack things where they're told to stack them.</p><p>Since the sleeping rooms can't be locked, workers and teamsters often have Bog Luck lock their cash and other valuables into the strong room for safekeeping. He keeps a record in a ledger book of all the personal items stored there and has a reputation for being meticulous about making sure everyone gets their belongings back—all of their belongings and <i>only</i> their belongings.</p><p>The key for this room is always on Bog Luck's belt, but the lock can be opened with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of @Item[voviZoZIc1Z0e4pw]{thieves' tools}.</p><p>The trapdoor is located in the southeast corner of the room. An empty crate nailed onto the door covers it; when the door is opened, the whole crate tips toward the north. Being nailed to the floor, the crate feels solid and full to a casual bump or shove. Only when it's tipped does the trick become obvious. It can be discovered with a thorough 20-minute search of the room or with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 124, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) check.</p><p>If characters search the strong room during the night, lizardfolk show up to cart away contraband.

Rooms</span></span> <p>The wagon drivers, escorts, and laborers who stay at the compound share the rooms. None are private rooms; all have bunks for at least four people, and the larger rooms sleep six. They contain bunks, trunks for belongings, and wooden floors covered with rushes.</p><p>None of the rooms have locks on their doors except Bog Luck's. If asked about locks, Bog Luck explains that they kept freezing in cold weather so people couldn't get into or out of their rooms. This excuse is credible; the upper room doors, in particular, often are coated with ice in the morning. In fact, Bog Luck removed the locks to strengthen his excuse for locking the strong room.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"667\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">6. Bog Luck's Room</span></span> <p>Bog Luck has this room to himself, so it's more spacious and comfortable than the others. He's seldom here except when sleeping, and he keeps the door locked. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check with @Item[voviZoZIc1Z0e4pw]{thieves' tools} can open it.

The noises he hears and mistakes for rats are the lizardfolk retrieving contraband from the strong room below. If questioned, he hears the noises every now and then, not every night. If pressed, he realizes that the sounds happen a few nights after a new load gets dropped off.

If they have a chance to see what's going on in the warehouse, they see that all the crates go into the strong room.

He mistakes those noises for rats, but they come from lizardfolk carrying contraband into the tunnel beneath the strong room.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">They can take the direct approach and inspect the strong room surreptitiously. This leads to a fight with lizardfolk if characters search the room in the dead of night. Getting in by picking the lock is the safest approach. Trying to lift the key from Bog Luck's belt can work, but it's risky. If he catches someone in the attempt, a beating is the best they can hope for. A smart character submits to this humiliation, because fighting back means that Bog Luck calls everyone else to help him punish the thief, and all the characters are ostracized from then on. Taking the beating means Bog Luck keeps the incident between the two of them.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Characters can arrange to have a room next to the Cult of the Dragon teamsters and listen through the walls to the cultists' conversation.

This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a lifethreatening situation.</p>\n<p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h3>Travel Pace</h3>\n<p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Forced March. </strong>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.apBZudO4UA1wj7aC]{Exhaustion}.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounts and Vehicles. </strong>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don&rsquo;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>\n<p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.TjWk2mpNXjDdfIDM]{Carpet of Flying}, allow you to travel more swiftly.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Travel Pace</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Pace</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Distance Traveled per . . .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minute</td>\n<td>Hour</td>\n<td>Day</td>\n<td>Effect</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fast</td>\n<td>400 feet</td>\n<td>4 miles</td>\n<td>30 miles</td>\n<td>- 5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>300 feet</td>\n<td>3 miles</td>\n<td>24 miles</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow</td>\n<td>200 feet</td>\n<td>2 miles</td>\n<td>18 miles</td>\n<td>Able to use stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>\n<p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground&mdash;all considered difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain&mdash; moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed&mdash;so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h2>Special Types of Movement</h2>\n<p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>\n<h3>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h3>\n<p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM&rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<h3>Jumping</h3>\n<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Jump. </strong>When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>\n<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn&rsquo;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM&rsquo;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump&rsquo;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>\n<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p>\n<p><strong>High Jump. </strong>When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>\n<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1&frac12; times your height.</p>","_id":"VdoONICb9PCrG6PW"}

In contrast to this rustic burg stands a mighty ice castle half hidden in a fog-shrouded ravine: walls stand forty feet high, huge narrow towers loom upward—one of blue ice, one crumbling—and all of it is built to a scale for giants.

The villagers want to keep the characters occupied, and they ask for them to tell tales of their journey, they inquire about the characters' families and where they are from, and they query how the party got here.</p><p>If asked about a place to sleep, Raggnar makes it clear that he isn't an innkeeper: there are no beds or rooms, and even the stable is full. If anyone asks why, he gives his usual excuse: \"Lord Marsten and his entourage are coming to hunt. All the servants are making things ready for their arrival.\" (This is pure nonsense, of course—he has no rooms other than his own.) If the characters just wait a moment, Raggnar says he will offer them his own chambers, for a steep fee of 10 gp. \"I'll clear out a few things and it is all yours.\" This is also a stalling tactic, though he'll certainly take the money.</p><p>Because the cultists are about to ship a castle full of treasure from the village, they desperately don't want the characters to find anything suspicious, such as wagons loaded with chests (there's no room to hide a caravan in a village this small) or their wyvern mounts in the stables (see area 3).

Anyone listening carefully hears a bellowing noise, though (no check required). The cult keeps two @Actor[LAUatoFqus1JGYTx]{wyverns} in the stable; sometimes, they unleash a wyvern-sized roar.</p><p>Cracked sheep bones and a few ox skulls cover the stable floor.

If the check fails by 5 or more, the wyvern strenuously objects and attacks the character once with its tail stinger as a reaction.

The binding kept dragons from taking these castles for their own, and the bond still holds centuries later.</p><p>The cult has struck a bargain with the castle's owner, a cloud giant named Blagothkus who harbors no particular hatred of dragonkind (or anything else, for that matter). The spirit of his deceased wife, Esclarotta, controls the castle's propulsion and buoyancy. The cult cannot afford to alienate Blagothkus, because the castle's spirit will not obey them.</p><p>Skyreach Castle is carved from ice so thick as to be opaque. The ice is as strong and impenetrable as granite, thanks to ancient cloud giant wizardry. Towers and walls surround an iceberg core that's been hollowed out to serve as the lair of a powerful white dragon allied with the cult.

{"_id":"eU8ieGULb34A7bpT","name":"Movement and Position","permission":{"default":0,"fNZMR0wRZYko05MN":3},"folder":"z12TjRRwJKqBE135","sort":600001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>\n<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>\n<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you&rsquo;re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Up Your Move</h2>\n<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>\n<h3>Moving between Attacks</h3>\n<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>\n<h3>Using Different Speeds</h3>\n<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you&rsquo;ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can&rsquo;t use the new speed during the current move.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>\n<h2>Difficult Terrain</h2>\n<p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briarchoked forests, treacherous staircases&mdash;the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>\n<h2>Being Prone</h2>\n<p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.ZkXz0qdkNBkKE6tN]{prone}, a condition described in @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.lrgT2KMBGTgZD4sA]{appendix PH-A}.</p>\n<p>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.</p>\n<p>For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can&rsquo;t stand up if you don&rsquo;t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>\n<p>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Interacting with Objects Around You</h4>\n<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>\n<li>open or close a door</li>\n<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>\n<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>\n<li>take a bauble from a table</li>\n<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>\n<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>\n<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>\n<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>\n<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>\n<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>\n<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>\n<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>\n<li>extinguish a small flame</li>\n<li>don a mask</li>\n<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>\n<li>put your ear to a door</li>\n<li>kick a small stone</li>\n<li>turn a key in a lock</li>\n<li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li>\n<li>hand an item to another character</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Moving Around Other Creatures</h2>\n<p>You can move through a nonhostile creature&rsquo;s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature&rsquo;s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature&rsquo;s space is difficult terrain for you.</p>\n<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can&rsquo;t willingly end your move in its space.</p>\n<p>If you leave a hostile creature&rsquo;s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h2>Flying Movement</h2>\n<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{Fly} spell.</p>\n<h2>Creature Size</h2>\n<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Size Categories</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Space</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>2&frac12; by 2&frac12; ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>5 by 5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 by 5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>10 by 10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>15 by 15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>20 by 20 ft. or larger</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Space</h3>\n<p>A creature&rsquo;s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn&rsquo;t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway, other creatures can&rsquo;t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>\n<p>A creature&rsquo;s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there&rsquo;s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p>\n<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there&rsquo;s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>\n<h3>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h3>\n<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that&rsquo;s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it&rsquo;s in the smaller space.</p>"}

The heroes must find out where all that loot is going, which means taking a long, danger-filled trip northward.</p><p>The characters should travel from the abandoned cult camp southeast of Greenest to the city of Elturel on the River Chionthar. Their route takes them back through Greenest, where they can return any stolen goods that they recovered from the cult and recuperate from their wounds. Nighthill greets the characters with delight and respect. He tells them that before Leosin Erlanthar left town, he bought horses and riding gear for the characters to speed their journey to Elturel. The horses are being kept at the dealer's stables until the characters are ready to leave for Elturel; all their costs are paid for.</p><p>On horseback, characters can travel the 200 miles from Greenest to Elturel in about six days. They make the journey without incident, unless you throw an encounter or two at them to spice up the trip or to increase their XP totals. Encounters with bandits, humanoid clans, and roving monsters are appropriate in the untamed expanses of the Greenfields.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"606\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elturel</span></span> <p>Elturel, a large, orderly city overlooking the River Chionthar, is filled with merchants, river traders, and farmers' markets. Its most distinguishing feature is a brilliant magical light that hovers above it, illuminating it day and night. This light is painful to undead and is visible from almost every corner of Elturgard (of which Elturel is the capital), appearing from afar as a star or distant sun.</p><p>When the characters meet Ontharr Frume, they find him to be a good-natured paladin of Torm, the god of heroics and bravery. He is a man of action who loves jokes and pranks, a stiff drink, and a friendly scuffle.</p><p>If characters ask for Leosin Erlanthar when they arrive in Elturel, none of the locals know him. If they ask for Ontharr Frume, anyone can direct them to the \"headquarters\" of Frume's faction, the Order of the Gauntlet, at a tavern called A Pair of Black Antlers. If the characters arrive within a tenday of Erlanthar's departure from Greenest, then the monk is still there with his handful of disciples, too.</p><p>You can spend as much or as little time on interactions in Elturel as you and your players want. Characters are guaranteed to have a good time in Frume's company, provided they consider continual drinking, arm-wrestling, horseback riding contests, sparring, and weapon training to be a good time. If the players don't realize it, Erlanthar finds a quiet moment to be sure the characters understand that impressing Frume with their prowess, their honesty, and their drive is in their long-term interest. The characters can make a positive impression on Frume by winning a few contests (resolved quickly with opposed skill or ability checks) or sparring matches against his troopers or by telling entertaining tales of their exploits during the Greenest raid, in the raiders' camp, and in the dragon caves.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"607\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Order of the Gauntlet</span></span> <p>Late in the evening, after a day when Frume has been suitably impressed by the characters, he sends one of his squires to summon them to a private room in the tavern.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \" ><p>Frume's squire shows you to a private space off the tavern's common room and closes the door when he leaves.

Characters might have heard of the older Harpers, but they're unlikely to know much about the secretive group beyond what is generally rumored: that the Harpers are dedicated to furthering equality and justice and to keeping power out of the hands of those who don't deserve it. Erlanthar explains that the Harpers are loosely organized; agents are allowed wide freedom of action.</p><p>Ontharr Frume represents the Order of the Gauntlet. His order shares many of the Harpers' principles, but the two organizations are very different. The Order of the Gauntlet emphasizes faith, vigilance, and constant struggle against threats of evil. Many of its members are clerics and paladins, but the order welcomes anyone who shares its ideals. Discipline is key, and the order is distinctly more structured and hierarchical than the Harpers.</p><p>The top concern of both groups is the Cult of the Dragon. In the past, the cult was more active to the east and it was focused on creating dracoliches. Its shift to the Sword Coast and new emphasis on living dragons and on Tiamat are cause for concern. The cult is on the move and it's up to something big; the Order of the Gauntlet, the Harpers, and a third allied group known as the Emerald Enclave want to thwart the cult's plans.</p><p>In this meeting, Frume and Erlanthar are offering the characters the chance to join their factions. At this early stage, there is no pay for members and there are no ranks. What they can offer is help and support from other members and allies, who are spread from Nashkel and Candlekeep in the south to Neverwinter and Mirabar in the north. The horses that Erlanthar arranged for the characters are just one small example of the aid the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet can provide.</p><p>Harpers can be recognized by the group's symbol: a silver harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon. Some people wear the symbol openly, and others keep it concealed. Erlanthar wears his as a medallion around his neck when he is certain that he's not heading into a potential captive situation—sometimes openly and sometimes tucked away. Members of the Order of the Gauntlet wear their holy symbols openly. (Frume's is the right-handed gauntlet of Torm.) The order's universal symbol is a gauntlet grasping a sword by the blade. Frume wears such a symbol on a pendant around his neck, hidden below his flowing beard.</p><p>Characters don't need to join either faction, but there are advantages to doing so and no real drawbacks. Even if characters don't agree to join, Frume and Erlanthar try to enlist their aid in tracking the cult's shipments.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"608\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Mission</span></span> <p>Thanks to the characters, the Harpers now know that the cult is amassing treasure and shipping it north. Where exactly this treasure is going and what the cult plans to do with it are the next two questions that need answering. Frume and Erlanthar would like the characters to join the cult's caravan and accompany it on the journey. They could get themselves hired as guards—if not by the cult's wagon masters, then by other merchants who are traveling in the same direction at the same time. Merchants from different companies commonly join together to form larger trains for protection. Frume has contacts among the many merchants of the region and is certain he can arrange a job.</p><p>Timing is an issue. The tracks leaving the cultists' camp and the map from Mondath's chamber both indicate that the wagons were heading west to pick up the Coast Way road, where they would turn north to Beregost and Baldur's Gate, a journey of about 550 miles. The wagons would take twenty-five to thirty days for that trip, depending on conditions. The wagons pulled out at least a day ahead of the characters' return to the camp, and the characters probably spent a day exploring the abandoned camp and clearing out the dragon hatchery. Returning to Greenest, resting, and traveling to Elturel account for eight to ten more days. Unless the characters walked to Elturel or lounged for days in Greenest before coming north, they should have at least ten to fifteen days before the cult's wagons reach Baldur's Gate.</p><p>The River Chionthar flows directly from Elturel to Baldur's Gate. A sailing vessel can make that trip downstream in about three days if it ties up overnight for safety, or two if it risks pushing on through the night by lamplight. Frume has already arranged for such a boat to leave at dawn the next morning. They are also provided with 50 gp each to cover expenses on the trip.</p><p>If the characters turn down this mission, Frume makes some remarks about how they aren't the people he thought they were, and he leaves the meeting more than a little bit angry. Erlanthar stays and makes one more appeal to their sense of honor and duty. If the characters still turn him down, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out a soft leather pouch, which he hands to one of the characters. Inside is a magnificent ruby worth 1,200 gp. He explains that if they take the mission, this ruby will be waiting for them in the hands of a Harper agent in Waterdeep.</p><p>That night, Frume sees that the characters are all equipped with new clothing and gear, and even new weapons if they want. He suggests that they change their appearance as much as they can in simple ways, to reduce the odds of anyone they might have met at the cult camp recognizing them.</p><p>The trip downriver to Baldur's Gate is uneventful, regardless of whether it takes three days or two. The characters can bring their horses along on the boat if they wish. The horses won't like it, but they'll manage.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"609\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Baldur's Gate</span></span> <p>Baldur's Gate is a bustling center of trade, with goods coming from north and south by wagon along the Trade Way and by ship on the Sea of Swords, and from the east along the River Chionthar and from Cormyr and Sembia. Baldur's Gate is situated on a prominent bluff next to the river, overlooking an excellent natural harbor. It is divided into three distinct segments: the Upper City where the richest and most influential citizens live and where the city's marketplace (the Wide) is located; the Lower City, which surrounds the harbor and where most of the city's merchants live and conduct their business; and the Outer City, which lies outside the walls and where most of the city's laborers reside in conditions that vary from crowded but clean to squalid.</p><p>Depending on timing, characters might have just a few days to wait in Baldur's Gate, or up to a tenday. Most of that time should be spent contacting a merchant recommended by Frume and arranging affairs so they can spot the cult wagons when they arrive.</p><p>Frume's contact is a human trader named Ackyn Selebon. He operates an equipage business in the Outer City north of the city wall, in a district called Blackgate. There he sells all the material needed for long-distance freight hauling: wagons, rope, netting, grease, chains, wheels, and so on. His shop also repairs wagons. He is not directly involved in the hiring of guards for caravans, but he knows people who are. With him to vouch for the characters, they should have no trouble getting hired on as guards for a northbound caravan, but he can't give them work with a specific merchant.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"610\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hiring Out</span></span> <p>Baldur's Gate doesn't allow wagons, pack animals, horses, or even dogs into the city. The streets are so narrow, steep, and slick from frequent rain that heavy wagons would be a menace. This is actually one of the reasons why Baldur's Gate is such a bustling commercial hub: for goods to pass through the city from south to north, for example, they must be unloaded in the Outer City east of the wall, carried through the city by porters on foot, and reloaded onto different wagons north of the city for the rest of their journey. No road conveniently bypasses the city—a situation that the gate's profiteering intermediaries work hard to maintain. Most merchants find it easier to sell their loads to those intermediaries and consignment dealers when they reach Baldur's Gate, buy a new load of exotic goods from somewhere far away, and turn around and head back home, where they can again sell the new goods at a profit.</p><p>Along with wagons, guards seldom make a continuous journey through Baldur's Gate. Guards for northbound caravans are typically hired in Blackgate where northbound wagons begin their journey. Selebon tells the characters that if they hang around any of the taverns or tent saloons near his shop, they are sure to see all the northbound traffic. They shouldn't hesitate to use him as a reference if a potential employer asks for one.</p><p>The northbound journey from Baldur's Gate is arduous, so merchants travel together for safety. Each merchant hires guards independently, but the common belief is that if everyone hires two or three and enough wagons travel together, the caravan is well protected.</p><p>Within a few days (the wait is up to you and the timing you've worked out for the cargo's arrival from the camp), characters spot people they recognize from the cult's camp on the plateau. Rezmir, being a half-dragon, can't travel openly in Baldur's Gate; she'd be attacked by a mob. The city's wealthy elite, however, often travel the streets in screened or curtained palanquins for both comfort and privacy. Rezmir does the same. When characters spot familiar faces from the cult camp, the cultists are carrying or accompanying a palanquin where Rezmir rides. They might catch a glimpse of her through a briefly parted curtain if they're observant.</p><p>Rezmir and her bodyguards come to Selebon's yard to purchase five wagons and supplies (having sold the other wagons south of the city). Once they are equipped, local porters pack merchandise and supplies onto the wagons, cover them in canvas, and lash them down.</p><p>After the characters have identified the cultists' wagons and seen their arrangements, they should have an easy time getting hired as guards. They can apply to the cultists if they feel like being reckless, but other merchants are making the same preparations to leave on the morrow.

If questioned, Jos claims to be just another Thayan expatriot trying to find refuge while his country is controlled by undead monsters. In fact, other than the denial that he's a Red Wizard, this is all true.</p><p>Jos buys space aboard one of the cult wagons, although they turned away everyone else who sought passage earlier in the journey.

Outwardly, the Black Network provides mercenaries and other forms of muscle for hire. Informally, it is known as a criminal society akin to a widespread thieves guild. Secretly, its leaders seek to extend their shadowy fingers into every throne room and ruling council chamber in Faerûn. Like the Harpers, the Zhentarim too are aware that the Cult of the Dragon is on the move, and they need to know the cult's plans so they can prevent them from interfering with the Zhentarim's own plans, plus perhaps take advantage of the plunder possibilities.</p><p>That's why Gleamsilver joins the caravan. The Black Network's spies learned that the cult is moving freight northward, and, like the characters, she was tasked with finding out what they're hauling and where it's headed. Those above her seriously considered wiping out the caravan with mercenaries disguised as bandits, ransacking the wagons, and torturing cult members for the desired information. Fortunately for the characters, Gleamsilver persuaded her superiors to give her a shot at uncovering the truth in a less bloody fashion. If she hasn't come up with something useful by the time the caravan reaches Waterdeep, she will put plan B—the one involving mass murder—into action.</p><p>Despite the vast gulf between their outlooks, the Black Network and the Harpers have a common enemy, and that is pushing them into an unlikely alliance. Gleamsilver is the antithesis of a hero—she is self-serving, a skilled thief and liar, and willing to murder anyone who stands between her and her goal.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"614\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Nonplayer Characters</span></span> <p>This list of twenty NPCs is provided for when you need one quickly.

Horse-drawn or mule-drawn freight wagons cover 15 miles per day, depending on conditions. The animals need one day off after every six days of hauling to recover from their work. All things considered, the trip is expected to take two months.</p><p>The caravan leaving Baldur's Gate contains the three wagons of the Cult of the Dragon plus [[/r 2d4]] more. Not all travelers are merchants. A wagon might carry a family relocating to the north or a diplomat on a mission to Waterdeep. People and wagons join the caravan along the way, and others leave according to the dictates of business and fortune. Some travelers ride horses, some walk beside the wagons, and some pay the merchants to ride aboard their wagons. On several occasions, characters notice the cult teamsters turning away passengers even though they have spare room on their wagons.</p><p>Nothing identifies the cult's wagons as anything but typical merchants hauling northbound freight. They don't bunch up during the day or camp together at night. As far as anyone else knows, their only connection is that they're part of this caravan.</p><p>Rezmir and eight of her guards leave Baldur's Gate secretly ahead of the caravan and ride north at a fast clip. They are headed for Castle Naerytar in the Mere of Dead Men and won't be seen again until <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,6\"   >chapter 6</a>. She leaves twelve @Actor[oIZsknvqHKDlUmAn]{guards} behind. One travels with each wagon, acting as a guard and assistant to the teamster. The other nine are cloaked as private travelers in two distinct groups, seeking company and protection in the caravan for their journey.</p><p>The wagons travel for about eight hours per day, with a few stops to feed and water the horses and mules. Many nights are spent camping along the road. Most small towns have roadside inns if travelers want more comfort, and walled hostelries catering to wagon caravans are spread a few days apart. Animals and travelers can rest comfortably at these walled compounds while wagons are safely locked inside. The map for <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,5\"   >chapter 5</a> shows a structure that once served that purpose. It can be used as the model for a typical hostelry if needed.</p><p>The most difficult part of the journey is near the beginning. A few days' travel north of Baldur's Gate brings the caravan into a countryside known as the Fields of the Dead. The road twists and wanders through hills dotted with ancient battlefields, dolmens, and barrow mounds. Common wisdom holds that it's a very bad idea to light a fire on a hilltop at night in the Fields of the Dead, because the light attracts monsters from miles around. Crossing this territory takes several days, during which everyone will be edgy and on watch.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"636\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Random Road Events</span></span> <p>The journey north lasts about forty days, and most travelers hope these days are monotonous and uneventful. This being Faerûn, that's never the case.</p><p>Many days pass with no excitement, but others see monster attacks, strange incidents, excitement at roadside stops, meetings with NPCs, and the ever-present question of where the cult's wagons are headed. You can pace these events however you like. Use a few, use them all, or make up more of your own.</p><p>On a trip of this length, checking for random events every hour is excessive. The Trade Way sees a lot of travelers and it is relatively (if not entirely) safe. Check for a random event each day by rolling a [[/r d20]]. On a roll of 16 or higher, one or more events occur as indicated below:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">16 means an event occurs in the morning</li><li class=\"rd__li \">17 means an event occurs during the first rest stop</li><li class=\"rd__li \">18 means an event occurs in the afternoon</li><li class=\"rd__li \">19 means an event occurs in the evening or night</li><li class=\"rd__li \">20 means one event occurs in the morning and another during afternoon or night</li></ul><p>When an event occurs, select one that seems appropriate to the location, the timing, and the backstory that the characters have thus far, or you can roll a [[/r d12]] to select one randomly. You can substitute a random bandit (daytime) or monster (nighttime) attack for any other event if a dose of instant action is needed.</p><p>Experience point awards for these events are up to you. We recommend 300 XP per character for each situation the heroes resolve successfully. Ideally, the characters have the chance to complete eight or nine of these events. If you use the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 5th level at the end of this journey.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"637\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trade Way Events</span></span> <table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\" >[[/r d12]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Event</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\" >1</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Adventuring Life</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\" >2</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Animal Abuse</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\" >3</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Bane of the Mountains</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\" >4</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Contraband</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\" >5</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Everything Has a Price</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\" >6</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Fungus Humongous</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\" >7</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >The Golden Stag</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\" >8</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Payback</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"9\" data-roll-max=\"9\" >9</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >No Room at the Inn</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"10\" data-roll-max=\"10\" >10</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Roadside Hospitality</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"11\" data-roll-max=\"11\" >11</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Spider Woods</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"12\" data-roll-max=\"12\" >12</td><td class=\"col-10\"  >Stranded</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"638\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventuring Life</span></span> <p>Another group of adventurers joins the caravan or is staying at the same roadside inn.

This is an excellent opportunity for the characters to see some of the contraband and even to get friendly with the cultists by helping them repair their wagon.</p><p>The cult members are angry that people saw the contents of their spilled cargo. Their instructions, direct from Wyrmspeaker Rezmir, were to keep the material secure and secret. Witnesses who show much interest in the jewelry or who ask questions might need to be silenced.

The NPC tries to buy it, but the offered price is low. The NPC persists through the day, becoming more obnoxious without getting any more generous. Unless the character takes special precautions, the object disappears overnight. If the character accuses the NPC publicly the following morning, they make an enduring enemy; that NPC doesn't have the item and is incensed at the accusation. Someone else who witnessed the conversations the day before decided the other NPC provided perfect cover for a little nighttime thievery and took the missing item. To find the item, characters need to surreptitiously search people's bags and wagons, since few people will agree to have their belongings rifled through as if they were common thieves—especially not a common thief.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"643\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fungus Humongous</span></span> <p>After two days and nights of rain, lightning, and strange whistling sounds on the wind, characters awaken to see that the surrounding countryside is blanketed with fungus.

Besides that, the sounds spook the animals and make them impossible to control.</p><p>The mushrooms are growing so fast on the rain-soaked ground that a person can almost see them getting bigger. They were the size of champagne corks when first noticed; within an hour, they grow six inches tall, and a foot tall an hour later. Their growth slows down after that, but by then, most people in the caravan are certain that all is doomed.</p><p>Anyone can literally sweep a path through the mushrooms with a heavy broom, a scythe, or a tree branch. The noise is distressing. Everyone involved in this process must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the character is overcome with feelings of grief and remorse, seemingly triggered by hearing thousands of tiny cries of pain and death groans but which is in fact the result of inhaling mildly toxic spores released by the immature fungi. Affected characters break down after [[/r 1d20]] minutes and simply can't face those sounds anymore. They have nightmares for days to come, until the toxin is completely out of their system. You can impose even more lingering results if you like, such as a lifelong aversion to eating mushrooms of any kind.</p><p>People can clear a path through the mushrooms with six man-hours of work (six people could do it in one hour, or three people could do it in two hours).</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"644\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Golden Stag</span></span> <p>On a beautiful, sunny afternoon, a herd of @Actor[jJ68VE4YQqJY3BXq]{deer} is spotted grazing on a nearby hill. The travelers take such opportunities to hunt fresh meat for the larder. This herd, however, includes a magnificent stag (use @Actor[lPq1MOrN8r0hO2ra]{elk} statistics) that shimmers in the light as if its coat is spun from gold and its antlers plated with platinum. Nearly everyone in the caravan who can handle a bow wants to bring down that beast. Its pelt would be worth a fortune, even if it's not real gold. A few of the more cautious types warn that the creature is clearly a blessed being and that killing it would bring bad luck on the caravan, but no more than two or three people are persuaded. In minutes, the hunt is on, and the deer herd scatters into the nearby forest and through farmers' fields.</p><p>The characters can join the chase, try to talk people down, protect the stag, or ignore the situation, as they see fit. It can be tracked through the forest with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 112, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Survival</span>) check. A new check must be made every 500 yards.</p><p>The stag leads hunters on a 1,500-yard chase to a moss-grown, ivy-draped ruin in the forest. There, one of three things can happen. Choose the one that best suits your game.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The stag can be cornered, fought, and killed. It is a normal stag but with a breathtakingly beautiful coat of golden fur. If the local farmers learn that it's been killed, they grab their pitchforks and longbows and threaten to overrun the caravan unless they are paid 500 gp for their loss; the stag brought them luck.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The stag greets the characters in Sylvan. If none of the characters speak that language, it switches to Elvish, and if no one responds again, it tries heavily accented, pidgin Common. It assures them that they are on the right track, and they must continue following the river of gold until they reach the castle in the sky. Sadly, their path will be filled with hardship and blood. To aid them, it offers the character a +1 longbow. The bow appears on the ground before them, and then the stag fades from view saying, \"Not all will survive...\"</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When the characters search the tumbled ruins, they find no sign of the stag but see a thin person who resembles a wood elf with bright golden skin. The young male is naked and either is wearing an antlered headpiece or has delicate antlers growing from his head. He drops to his knees and beseeches the characters in a dialect of Elvish that is archaic but understandable. He is an elf prince, and the stones around them were once the beautiful castle where he ruled. But he was cursed by the father of the woman he loved to transform into a golden stag whenever he steps outside these walls. He has lived with the curse for so long that his kingdom is forgotten, his castle is fallen to ruin, and he no longer remembers his own name. He believes that a wizard somewhere can release him from the curse, but wherever he goes, people try to kill him for his golden coat. If the characters allow him to accompany them and protect him, he will do his best to reward them at the end of the journey. The story is true; several wizards in Waterdeep could remove the curse. The elf cannot pay a reward at the end, but the characters earn 500 XP apiece for believing him and protecting him. That job won't be easy, because people in the caravan find their story ridiculous and look for opportunities to kill the stag.</li></ul></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"645\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Payback</span></span> <p>As the caravan rounds a bend in the road, a human head can be seen sitting in the middle of the road a hundred yards ahead.

Amoffel passed information to another Harper at a roadside inn, and members of the caravan witnessed the meeting. The cultists manufactured a story that he was passing information to bandits. The merchants were unwilling to kill him outright, but they were willing to leave him buried in the road and \"let providence decide the man's fate.\"</p><p>Amoffel has Harper contacts in Waterdeep and knows his way around the city. He can be a useful ally when this caravan reaches its destination.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"646\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">No Room at the Inn</span></span> <p>After a miserably wet, cold day that promises to become an even wetter, freezing night, the caravan arrives at a large inn. Upon entering the warm, comfortable common room to make arrangements for the night, the embarrassed innkeeper tells the characters that the entire inn is sold out; all the private rooms are taken and the common room is reserved for a private party. The caravan will need to spend the night outside. Looking around the room, the characters see just one group: an aristocratic judge and his entourage of three human dilettantes. They smirk at the characters while making comments such as \"sleep tight\" and \"have a pleasant evening\" followed by insults muttered under their breath about the characters' mud-spattered clothing and low breeding. If characters ask about sleeping in the stable, one of the nobles speaks up, saying, \"Our horses are rather picky about who they share space with. We had to reserve all of it, too, for their sake. You understand, I'm sure.\" His snooty friends have a good chuckle over that.</p><p>Spending this night in the wagons will be hard on the characters but will be misery for the unprotected horses and mules, and the only reason for it is the cruelty and arrogance of these snickering twits in the inn.</p><p>The NPCs in the inn won't be influenced by any sort of reason or debate or by offers of money. They find the situation enormously amusing and seem pleased by the prospect of the merchants and their animals suffering in the freezing rain all night. They needle and goad the characters and their fellow travelers at every opportunity, including from the doorway and windows of the inn when no one else is inside. If the characters don't start a fight, someone else from the caravan might.</p><p>In fact, these NPCs are four disguised @Actor[Mf2RkpVn2hL4aKfI]{veterans} traveling to Baldur's Gate in search of employment and out to have a good laugh over someone's misfortune.

Arietta and Zelina Innevar take a liking to some of the travelers—possibly, but not necessarily, a few of the characters—and spend the evening asking about their past, where they're headed, whether they have family, and so on. The sisters are actually two @Actor[UK19C17POOYxNiW3]{doppelgangers}. They can either attack someone that night or join the caravan for a few days while they study the travelers and choose their victims. When the time comes to strike, they wait until after dark, then try to lure their target away from other people by calling for assistance in a familiar voice. Fortunately for the characters and their fellow travelers, if one is defeated, the other one flees in a flurry of curses and vengeful threats.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"648\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spider Woods</span></span> <p>The Trade Way skirts around and between the huge Trollbark and Misty Forests, but it passes through many other, smaller forests that don't appear on maps. When the caravan is passing through one such wooded region, three @Actor[LOGlGDNfDixPckdP]{ettercaps} and two @Actor[UsrZG1cJfEnLSEgJ]{giant spiders} attack it. They are chiefly interested in taking horses, not merchandise, but they won't balk at taking people if they can't get horses. Two ettercaps go after horses while the third ettercap and the giant spiders keep the caravan guards busy. An ettercap can cut a horse free from its harness in 3 rounds. After that, they retreat into the trees, leading the horse away with reins of webbing. Without horses, the wagons are stranded. The characters' employer insists they go after the ettercaps and retrieve the stolen horses.</p><p>If the characters move quickly, they have a good chance to retrieve the horses alive. The animals leave a trail through the underbrush that's easy to follow; a successful DC 10 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 115, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Survival</span>) check is sufficient to keep on it. The horses are led away about half a mile to the ettercaps' lair. If characters charge straight in, they are attacked by three @Actor[LOGlGDNfDixPckdP]{ettercaps} and two @Actor[UsrZG1cJfEnLSEgJ]{giant spiders}. If they pause to observe for a few minutes, they see the ettercaps shoo the giant spiders away while they prepare for their feast of horse meat. The characters can then fight just the ettercaps for 6 rounds, before the spiders return to the sound of battle. The characters can't delay for long, however, because the ettercaps won't waste much time before killing and tucking into the horses.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"649\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Stranded</span></span> <p>This is an ideal event for the Fields of the Dead region, if one occurs there, but it can be used anywhere.</p><p>The caravan sees a fight happening ahead. A freight wagon is stranded on the road, its draft animals dead. A merchant (@Actor[upSEpcLt86Vj4uxp]{noble}) and three @Actor[oIZsknvqHKDlUmAn]{guards} are sheltered under the wagon, with crates dragged between the wheels for cover. They are plentifully supplied with crossbows and bolts, but the six @Actor[1FHWxhQWgvDnfbYL]{hobgoblins} and one @Actor[rXrsggWzuXtRK0Ex]{hobgoblin captain} assailing them seem content to keep them under siege until sundown, when they plan to rush the wagon with darkness as cover. These are Urshani hobgoblins, recognizable by their unusually savage appearance (even for hobgoblins). Urshani hobgoblins adorn themselves with wolf furs, paint worg heads onto their shields, and incorporate other wolf parts and icons in their armor and clothing.</p><p>First the hobgoblins must be driven off, then the injured attended to, and then something must be done about the stranded wagon.

At some point during the journey, the character who scored the lowest result on the Charisma check is recognized by a cultist.

Success means the character catches a cultist watching him or her suspiciously, noting who the character talks to, when the character eats, and where the character sleeps. Over the course of a few days, it should become obvious that this cultist has recognized the character. If characters delay taking action, the cultists strike first by trying to assassinate the characters in their bedrolls or perhaps by arranging an accident—a loose wheel, broken axle, or spooked lead horse might be an effective way to solve a problem. The only permanent solution to this problem for the characters is murder; the cultist with suspicions must be eliminated before he or she shares those suspicions with the others. Good characters may be reluctant to take this step; that's roleplaying. If they can find another way, that's excellent, but once the opposition recognizes someone, the situation is likely to end in death.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"652\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unwanted Attention</span></span> <p>The day after the caravan leaves Daggerford, have each character make a Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 117, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Insight</span>) check.

The lizardfolk expect no trouble near their camp, so if characters posted a watch, then those characters who are actively on watch notice the approaching lizardfolk automatically and the lizardfolk are surprised.

On close inspection, characters see mixed in among these things traces of civilization: glass beads, coins, costume jewelry, tiny mirrors, and stamped copper and tin amulets of the sort that can be bought for a few pennies at any trinket shop or souvenir stand. None of it is magical.</p><p>During the questioning, have every character make a Charisma check. Whichever character scores highest makes a strong impression on a lizardfolk captive.

He speaks enough pidgin Common to converse in simple terms, in case no one in the party speaks Draconic.</p><p>How Snapjaw goes about opening a dialog depends on the situation. If he's the only surviving lizardfolk or he's questioned out of earshot from the others, he can speak openly. If several lizardfolk are tied up and they're being questioned together, he could sprinkle words of Common into his Draconic replies, such as \"want to help\" and \"talk alone.\" If several lizardfolk are tied up and left alone for a few minutes, he could scratch a similar message into the ground. He might try provoking a character into a wrestling match or a duel (if your players are the type to take up such a challenge), and then whisper his message into the character's ear.</p><p>If characters don't mistreat Snapjaw and don't kill any more lizardfolk than they need to, he becomes a reliable ally for as long as they work against the cult and the bullywugs. Roll a die for each of the other lizardfolk captives. On an even roll, Snapjaw persuades that lizardfolk to join his little revolt.

He lived there a relatively short time before the growing swamp flowed past the castle on all sides and made the location too remote for even his taste. After the structure sat abandoned for years, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers claimed it. They built an observatory into the top level of the keep, where they installed a piece of magic equipment called the <i>farseer of Illusk</i>. But the astrologers vanished mysteriously after a few years.</p><p>After the disappearance of the astrologers, the castle again fell into disuse. It was built to withstand its cold, watery environment, so the encroaching water hasn't undermined the walls or flooded the dungeon. Over decades of abandonment, however, it filled with debris and attracted many unpleasant dwellers. Then Rezmir happened upon the castle on one of her trips into the mere to study and negotiate with the black dragon Voaraghamanthar. Rezmir suspected the castle could become a useful stronghold for her, being located so conveniently close to the lair of a black dragon. She explored the structure, cleared the giant spiders out of the tower, and forged an alliance with the nearby tribe of bullywugs.</p><p>During that time, the half-dragon was still thinking of the castle simply as a fortified hideout. When she discovered the portal in the dungeon and learned that it connected to an abandoned lodge in the Graypeak Mountains, a new thought took shape. Lugging large amounts of treasure fifteen miles through the mere would not be easy, but if it cut 700 miles of wagon transport out of the picture, it would be worth the difficulty—especially if bullywugs and lizardfolk did all the hard work. Rezmir laid claim to both structures, turned the Graypeak Mountain hunting lodge over to a trusted Cult of the Dragon associate (a half-elf named Talis who now despises Rezmir—see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,7\"   >chapter 7</a>), and set about making Castle Naerytar an essential hub in the cult's treasure-amassing activity in the North.</p><p>Through diplomacy and intimidation, and by leveraging the influence of Voaraghamanthar with the monstrous creatures of the mere, Rezmir created an uneasy alliance in the Mere of Dead Men and brought her vision into reality.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"690\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Factions</span></span> <p>Three power groups operate around Castle Naerytar: the Cult of the Dragon, a band of bullywugs, and a lizardfolk tribe. The black dragon Voaraghamanthar, along with its kobold and lizardfolk minions, could constitute a fourth group if it took an active hand in events, but for now it is biding its time to see how events develop.</p><p>Rezmir's three-way alliance is unstable. The cultists despise living in the swamp and have little respect for the bullywugs or lizardfolk; the leader of the bullywugs would like to seize Castle Naerytar for his own purposes; the bullywugs in general take every opportunity to push around the lizardfolk; and the lizardfolk chafe under the abuse of the bullywugs and wonder why Voaraghamanthar doesn't step in to protect them.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"691\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cult of the Dragon</span></span> <p>Although Rezmir is responsible for resurrecting Castle Naerytar and claiming it for the Cult of the Dragon (in name only; she considers it her personal property), an elf Wearer of Purple named <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dralmorrer%20borngray_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'dralmorrer%20borngray_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Dralmorrer Borngray</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>) commands the castle for Rezmir. The half-dragon needs to show up occasionally to remind the bullywugs and lizardfolk that the Cult of the Dragon is really in charge, but Borngray runs the operation.</p><p>Dralmorrer Borngray is a member of the Eldreth Valuuthra, a group of elf supremacists dedicated to removing humanity from Faerûn. He longs for the age of great empires before humans claimed the continent. Being from Evermeet, he believes that his island home will be safely sheltered from the dragons' reign. Elves on the mainland will suffer, but that will be a small price to pay for the terror that will fall on humanity.</p><p>The elf idolizes Rezmir in all ways but one: he rues her decision to elevate the bullywugs in their alliance. In Borngray's opinion, the lizardfolk would be more useful, more reliable, and more appropriate allies than the repulsive bullywugs are. He cannot alter the arrangement without countering Rezmir's orders, but Borngray has taken small steps to restore the lizardfolk's tribal pride, such as by trying to teach them metallurgy. His effort has met with little success.</p><p>Borngray is loyal to the cult and yearns for Tiamat's return. He genuinely looks forward to the whole world lying helpless under the claws of dragons, both because that's where the world belongs, and because it will mean that his job at Castle Naerytar is finished. The second-best day of his life will be the day when Borngray can scrape the mud and stink of the Mere of Dead Men off his boots and return to someplace civilized. He has never mentioned his desire to leave to the bullywugs, whom he considers revolting necessities.</p><p>Only a handful of true Cult of the Dragon initiates and officers resides at the castle. All of them are noted in the castle description. They act as overseers and aides to Borngray and Rezmir.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"692\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bullywugs</span></span> <p>The band of bullywugs serving the Cult of the Dragon follows the dictates of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#pharblex%20spattergoo_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'pharblex%20spattergoo_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Pharblex Spattergoo</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>), a rare bullywug who has mastered shamanistic magic. His \"religion\" is a mishmash of confused tradition, borrowed mysticism, hallucinogenic intoxicants, and manufactured lore that serves more as a road to personal power for Pharblex than as a spiritual system for the bullywugs. Pharblex's spellcasting holds his followers together, and that makes him useful to Rezmir.</p><p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/028-tod-06-02.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Pharblex Spattergoo\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/028-tod-06-02.png\" alt=\"Pharblex Spattergoo\"  >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Pharblex Spattergoo</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p>Pharblex hopes that when Tiamat returns, Rezmir will hand Castle Naerytar over to him, and he will rule the entire Mere of Dead Men from the castle. The only obstacle he sees between himself and his goal is the castle's current master, Dralmorrer Borngray; the notion that someone might want to not live in a swamp has never entered Pharblex's narrow mind, and the bullywug seems deaf to Borngray's ironic and sarcastic jabs at the mere. When the time is right, Pharblex plans to remove the elf from the picture by any means necessary. It is unlikely that he would choose the middle of a battle against the characters, when he and Borngray are fighting side by side, to betray the elf—but it's not impossible. If it looks like the cult's operation at the castle is doomed, Pharblex is the sort of creature who will switch sides to save his slimy skin. The timing must be perfect, because he fears Rezmir more than he fears the characters. If, however, the characters have won the lizardfolk over to their side, slaughtered or driven off most of the bullywugs, overrun the castle, and are poised to kill Borngray and Pharblex in battle—Pharblex judges that the ideal time to forsake old allies and court new ones has arrived. He offers just about anything in exchange for the characters leaving him alive and in possession of Castle Naerytar (with or without the <i>farseer of Illusk</i> in operating condition).</p><p>The number of bullywugs around the castle fluctuates. They come and go as they please. On any given day, forty to fifty are camped outside the castle. Thirty-four more plus Pharblex live in the castle barracks (areas 1G and 2G). Another thirty to seventy are in the immediate area, close enough to respond within fifteen minutes to the beating of the drum in the barbican.</p><p>The bullywugs already believe themselves to be lords of the mere, and they act like it. They are easily confused, however. Under normal circumstances, they attack adventurers on sight, provided the bullywugs had superior numbers. They have grown accustomed to seeing cultists of many races coming and going around the castle, so when they see strangers, their first assumption is that the newcomers are more cultists. This assumption is reinforced if Snapjaw or other lizardfolk accompany the strangers or if the characters have any overtly cultish gear or clothing.</p><p>This doesn't mean characters can wander at will through the camp and the castle. Bullywug guards still challenge them to ask who they are and where they're going (in fractured pidgin Common if none of the characters speak Bullywug). They just don't assume that every stranger is an enemy and attack on sight.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"693\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lizardfolk</span></span> <p>The Scaly Death lizardfolk tribe has no leader. Pharblex killed its shaman, Suncaller, and the death left the tribe with an inferiority complex that was ripe for exploitation. When Rezmir promised that Voaraghamanthar would reward the tribe's labors for the cult, the lizardfolk were ready to listen.</p><p>Where the bullywugs fill the role of a static defense force, the lizardfolk perform five functions. First, they are the cult's laborers and porters. Lizardfolk did most of the heavy work while clearing debris from the castle, and they carry most of the treasure from the work camp to the castle on their backs and in their canoes. Second, they tend the giant lizards that are used to drag or carry especially heavy loads through the mere. Third, they do most of the hunting, fishing, and gathering to feed everyone at the castle. Fourth, they act as the castle's far-ranging scouts and outlying guards, since they are far superior to any bullywug at actively patrolling, ambushing, and laying traps. Fifth, a cadre of lizardfolk has been enlisted as elite guards for the castle itself. Borngray doesn't expect that any force would ever mount a real attack against the castle; it's too inaccessible, lying deep in the swamp. But if that unlikely event ever happened, he knows that the swaggering bullywugs would desert rather than fight an organized enemy. The lizardfolk, on the other hand, can be courageous and disciplined when they have a leader worth following. Borngray hopes to be that leader, at least to the small contingent of lizardfolk warriors he houses in the castle and rewards with special treatment. In exchange for their work, Borngray \"pays\" the tribe in metal weapons that are brought to the castle along with the loot.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bullywugs boss and bully the lizardfolk, emboldened by their superior numbers, the lizardfolk's instinctive awe of Pharblex's magic, and the absence of any restraining sign from Borngray or from the lair of the black dragon. Voaraghamanthar's silence, more than anything else, makes the lizardfolk wonder whether fate is punishing them for some unknown transgression. They grumble, and occasionally a few desert, but most of them bear up with reptilian stoicism.</p><p>Snapjaw is one of the few who has suggested rebelling against the hated bullywugs and the cultists. He hasn't done so openly, because that would invite retribution from the bullywugs, but he has spoken to a few fellow tribesfolk he trusts. Their response was interested but noncommittal; they intend to take revenge on the bullywugs, but not until the omens are right. Meanwhile, they endure—and stockpile weapons. Borngray has only a rough idea of how many lizardfolk are in the tribe all together, and he hasn't kept close count over how many swords, spears, daggers, shields, and metal-tipped arrows have been turned over to them. The lizardfolk are much better armed at this point than they let on to either the bullywugs or the cultists. When the time comes to move against the bullywugs, the lizardfolk intend for every bullywug throat and belly to be slit open with a new, razor-sharp steel blade.</p><p>Like the bullywugs, the lizardfolk's first assumption on seeing strangers is that they are cultists, or allies of the cultists, come to work or parley at the castle. They don't share the bullywugs' arrogance, however, so unless they are attacked, they don't really care who wanders through the camp. Lizardfolk on patrol or standing guard are an exception. They are alert, and they assume everyone is a potential enemy. They won't attack until they know for sure, lest they incur the wrath of Rezmir or Borngray for killing an ally. As outlying guards, their instructions are to alert the camp when strangers approach, keep the strangers under observation, and await further instructions.</p><p>The Scaly Death tribe comprises eighty lizardfolk warriors, both male and female. About half of them are in the vicinity of the castle at any given time; twenty-six live in the castle and the rest in reed huts (area 3). The others are away hunting, fishing, patrolling, hauling contraband from the work camp, or visiting their families in the tribal village (a few hours away to the southwest).</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"694\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Red Wizards</span></span> <p>Only one Red Wizard is present at Castle Naerytar: Azbara Jos, who was also in the cult camp on the Greenfields and traveled north with Rezmir. He has no interest in the Mere of Dead Men, bullywugs, or lizardfolk, and just slightly more interest in black dragons. He is here only as Rath Modar's liaison to Rezmir. The portal beneath the castle piques Jos's interest, however; portals are always of concern to the Red Wizards.</p><p>Adventurers appearing at this remote, secret site also interest him. If Azbara Jos sees the characters or learns of their presence, he arranges a private meeting—one that Rezmir and Borngray don't even know about, let alone attend. He wants to learn how much the characters know of the cult's plans, where and how they uncovered the information, who else knows about it, and what they think of the plan's chance to succeed. If the characters are captured and locked up in the castle, Jos finds an opportunity to ask all the same questions, again privately, but he is in a better position to force answers out of the characters.</p><p>This assumes the characters are at Castle Naerytar posing as cultists or hiding among the lizardfolk. If they're rampaging through the castle, killing everyone they meet, then Azbara Jos has only one concern: escaping through the portal before someone or something kills him.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"695\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Voaraghamanthar</span></span> <p>Voaraghamanthar is an adult black dragon who claims the Mere of Dead Men as his territory. Although many creatures live in the mere and dominate it to one extent or another, none challenge Voaraghamanthar's supremacy. The bullywugs consider him a constant threat and tremble whenever his shadow passes near. The yuan-ti grant him grudging respect and covet his immense wealth. The lizardfolk honor him and wonder why he allows the cultists to abuse them. The cultists venerate him and divert some of the arriving contraband to his lair as tribute.</p><p>Voaraghamanthar has a secret that is known to only two other creatures in Faerûn. One of them is Rezmir. The other creature <i>is</i> the secret: Waervaerendor, the twin brother of Voaraghamanthar. For centuries, these twins have misled the world into believing that only one dragon dwells in the Mere of Dead Men—one dragon that must travel at immense speed, since it has been spotted at widely separated locales in rapid succession. The siblings seldom leave their lairs, but when they do, they coordinate so they are never seen together or seen in two distant places at precisely the same time.</p><p>Rezmir persuaded the twins to pledge their aid to the cult, but so far, the pledge hasn't carried much weight. Neither dragon leaves its lair frequently enough to provide much help. Like all black dragons, these two are paranoid about all other dragons. Tiamat's potential return and the establishment of a vast dragon empire seem like remote possibilities compared to the real danger of tangling with another dragon, any of whom would gladly murder Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor for their hoards. That's the twins' outlook, anyway. While their concern over the murderous nature of other dragons is justified, the fact that they are two means they have little to fear from most solitary dragons. Rezmir is working hard to persuade them that they could gain great power by revealing their secret at the strategically correct moment. Until Tiamat's return looks more certain, however, Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor intend to keep playing it safe, stick close to home, and guard their secret.</p><p>Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor are not a true faction in the mere because they are not advancing any agenda of their own, but their presence affects the balance of power. Without Voaraghamanthar, the cult wouldn't be here at all. Without Voaraghamanthar, the lizardfolk probably could not have been maneuvered into making common cause with the bullywugs.</p><p>Characters should not encounter either of these dragons face to face in this adventure (they are likely to meet in <i>The Rise of Tiamat</i>). If characters stray from the lizardfolk's path between the work camp and Castle Naerytar, intentionally or unintentionally—if, for example, they follow will-o'-wisps into the mere—they could enter the blighted territory around one of the lairs. Many clues can inform characters that they're in dragon territory. First, they pass markers consisting of the acid-eaten skulls of humans, humanoids, yuan-ti, crocodiles, and just about every other creature that lives in the mere. The skulls hang from withered trees and from spikes driven into the ground.</p><p>Both dragons' lairs are heavily guarded by lizardfolk. The dragons' guards are selected from the Scaly Death lizardfolk that work for the cult. Kobolds infest the actual lairs, but they seldom come out into the mere.</p></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"696\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Squaring Off Against the Cult of the Dragon</span></span> <p>Characters have several options at Castle Naerytar, and events there can go in many directions. Here are the key points to keep in mind when running this chapter.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Rezmir and Azbara Jos do almost anything to avoid a battle with interfering adventurers. They have bigger concerns than the safety of Castle Naerytar and its occupants. If a battle develops, both of these characters head directly for the gate beneath the castle and teleport to Talis the White's hunting lodge (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,7\"   >chapter 7</a>). For purposes of this adventure, do everything you can to ensure that Rezmir and Jos survive this chapter. It's not a catastrophe if they don't, but it's much better if they do.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Dralmorrer Borngray and Pharblex Spattergoo have everything to lose if enemies of the cult overrun Castle Naerytar; a defeat would cost Borngray his hard-earned rank in the cult, and Spattergoo would lose the base from which he hopes to rule the mere after the cult is finished with the castle. They fight to the death to protect the castle (simultaneously buying time for Rezmir and Jos to escape). Despite their loathing for one another, they understand that they are much stronger together than apart. As soon as fighting breaks out, they join forces and cooperate.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The best place for Borngray and Pharblex to make their stand depends on how the attack develops; you'll need to play that part by ear. Their best ploy against a determined assault may be a fighting retreat through the castle and down into the caverns, where the narrow passages and giant frogs work in their favor.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The bullywugs are numerous but cowardly. They fight to protect Pharblex, but if he isn't immediately in sight—if Pharblex has retreated into the caverns while other bullywugs are fighting in the inner ward, for example—bullywugs who feel as if he has abandoned them are likely to leap away into the mere and never come back. If Pharblex is killed, most bullywugs desert immediately.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The lizardfolk are brave, but they despise the bullywugs. If characters haven't recruited the lizardfolk to their side, then the lizardfolk fight well whenever they're alone. If bullywugs are nearby, lizardfolk pull back and let the bullywugs bear the brunt of combat and casualties. If the lizardfolk have been won over to fighting alongside the characters, then they hunt bullywugs through the castle and grounds and murder them mercilessly. If bullywugs flee into the swamp, lizardfolk chase them. They are half-hearted when facing cultists—not because they fear the cultists but because they don't hate them, and they have a harder time mentally turning against that alliance.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The cultists are dedicated but not fanatics, and they are laborers, not soldiers. They fight bravely with Dralmorrer Borngray leading them. Without him, the cultists' attacks are uncoordinated and hesitant. Their situation becomes even worse if they are fighting against rebellious lizardfolk. In that case, without Borngray to egg them on, they are most likely to barricade themselves in the upper levels of the southwest tower or the library and try to ride out the slaughter.</li></ul></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"697\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching Castle Naerytar</span></span> <p>How characters approach Naerytar can set the tone for everything that happens at the castle.</p><p>Snapjaw knows where the lizardfolk pickets are posted about half a mile out from the castle. If he is with the characters, he can prevent them from blundering into a trap or an ambush. He talks to the six @Actor[kkqArv4eBp2mWqEo]{lizardfolk} guards if characters let him. What he tells them depends on the opinion he's formed about the characters.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">If Snapjaw isn't yet sure whether the characters are the saviors he hopes they are, he tells the guards that these are cultists coming to join those already in the castle. The guards accept that story without question and let everyone pass.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If the heroes have established strong trust between themselves and Snapjaw, he tells the guards that the characters are great warriors come to destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and that now is the time to make their move against the bullywugs. You can either decide for yourself how the guards react to that, or make a DC 10 Charisma check for Snapjaw. If the check succeeds, the guards are persuaded. If the check fails, the characters don't impress them. They won't take action against the bullywugs now, but they won't interfere with the characters, either. If the result is 5 or lower, these guards decide Snapjaw's talk of an uprising is dangerously rash, and they attack him.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If the characters have done nothing to win Snapjaw's trust or they've treated him no better than bullywugs would have, then he tells the guards that the characters are nothing but trouble, and the lizardfolk attack.</li></ul><p>If Snapjaw is not with the characters, they still have a chance to detect the guard outpost on their own.

When the mere expanded and surrounded the castle site, the moat flooded and overflowed. Now the whole site is swampy, and large pools of standing water dot the clearing.

Tangled brush and trees grow to within twenty feet of the walls on three sides of the castle. Only the front (southern) face is clear.</p><p>Bullywugs live in crowded, hastily made reed huts.

Five of them are in good condition; the sixth has a rotten bottom, and the lizardfolk never use it. If characters grab canoes in a hurry, there is a 1-in-6 chance they get the rotten one.

Animal Stockade</span></span> <p>The lizardfolk keep their giant lizards penned here. The five-foot-high wall of the stockade is made from sturdy logs driven into the earth, spaced about six inches apart, and bound together with twisted fiber. The lizards can carry or drag loads that are too massive for the lizardfolk, such as large timbers or impressive crocodiles. They are also used to raise stone onto the castle battlements through ropes and pulleys—technology that never ceases to amaze the lizardfolk. There are [[/r 2d4]] @Actor[iefxzEFHQd02zWmM]{giant lizards} in the pen at any given time. They are ill-tempered and attack anyone who comes within reach if their handlers aren't present to keep them under control. If set loose, they most likely romp away into the swamp. If the goal is to have the lizards rampage through the camp, someone needs to rile them up first. Poking them through the stockade wall with spears will do the trick.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"701\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">3. Longhouses</span></span> <p>The lizardfolk warriors live in these longhouses.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \" ><p>The longhouses are made from reeds bound into long, thick bundles and bent into upside-down, U-shaped ribs. The spaces between the ribs are latticed and thatched with more reeds. Each longhouse has a single, woven door in the center of one end wall. The construction technique used in the longhouses is ingenious.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The lizardfolk may be technologically backward, but they are masters of their environment. They show the same building talent in their traps and snares.</p><p>Inside, longhouses are roomy and well ventilated. The ground is covered with reed mats, and the interior is dry and airy. Gear hangs from pegs on the walls to keep it off the ground. Lizardfolk are especially careful with their new, steel weapons, which rust quickly when exposed to dampness. They fill small stone ovens with coals for heat. There are no open fireplaces; the danger from sparks is too great.</p><p>Each of these longhouses could house twenty-five lizardfolk comfortably, and more with some crowding. When Rezmir first negotiated with the lizardfolk, they intended to move the entire village here, and built accordingly. As more bullywugs also flocked to the castle and the real situation became apparent, the warriors instructed their families to stay behind. Thus, they have far more longhouse space at the castle than they need. Characters observing the area from hiding and judging solely from the longhouses would estimate conservatively that over a hundred lizardfolk live at the castle. They won't count anywhere near that many lizardfolk in the clearing. Snapjaw can explain the discrepancy, if he's around.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"702\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">4. Huts</span></span> <p>The bullywugs live in huts, which are crudely built.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \" ><p>A dozen or more huts are placed haphazardly on the boggy ground. Each is shaped like a slightly flattened dome. The doorways are open, but a low, short tunnel forces a creature to crawl into the hut. They are made of reeds woven through a lattice, with a generous layer of mud, grass, and dung smeared over the whole thing. Mud, swamp water, and muck slops between the huts and even flows in and out of the low, open doorways.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The interiors of the bullywugs' huts are the complete opposite of the lizardfolk's longhouses: wet, filthy, sloppily made, and reeking. The floors aren't just damp; they're churned into mud pits up to 2 feet deep, so the bullywugs can rest froglike in mud up to their eyeballs. They have no sense of privacy or personal space. At night, they crowd in atop one another until everyone is squeezed. Bullywugs aren't assigned to any particular huts. They sleep in whichever is most convenient when they grow tired, so it's common for some huts to be packed at night while others sit completely empty.</p><p>Eight @Actor[KmxKcpnhDFRFKsTv]{giant frogs} hop randomly among the huts or sit silently in the pools of standing water. These creatures were raised from tadpoles by the bullywugs and don't bother them, but they attack anyone else who carelessly wanders within reach of their 15-foot-long tongues.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"703\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">5. Moat</span></span> <p>The muddy water lapping against the castle walls is indistinguishable at a glance from the puddles and hip-deep water standing throughout the area, but it hides a moat. Portions of the moat around the southwest tower have filled in to ground level, but elsewhere it is 30 to 40 feet wide and up to 15 feet deep. The causeway (1A) arches over the moat, providing a visual clue that the water may be deeper than it appears. Anyone splashing around in the moat attracts the attention of six @Actor[aFgBEobp9bStMNDS]{crocodiles}.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"704\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">6. Main Gate</span></span> <p>This is the only entrance into the castle that's used. When the castle was built, a pair of stout wooden gates and an iron portcullis closed off this 12-foot-wide, 10-foot-high gateway. The gates are never closed; they now sag on their hinges so badly that it's not worth the effort of levering them into place for any reason short of an imminent attack. The portcullis is rigged so it can be dropped with a hard yank on a lever (located on the upper level, area 2A), but since it was last tested, the mechanism has rusted to the point where the gate will drop only 3 feet, then jam in place.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"705\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Inside Castle Naerytar</span></span> <p>The castle's exterior walls average 10 feet thick.

Unless a fight or other disturbance has happened somewhere, these guards are at low alertness.</p><p>Sloppy mud covers the stone floor of this large chamber. Planks have been laid from the gateway to the causeway entrance to create a 10-foot-wide raised boardwalk for the cultists, who don't enjoy walking through mud the way bullywugs do. The slippery mud makes everywhere off the planks difficult terrain for characters. A few tables have been thrown together from planks laid across barrels, with crudely made benches for seats. The tables and benches are nearly as muddy as the floor.</p><p>The barbican has no windows or arrow slits at ground level. During daytime, bright light is within 20 feet of the open gateway and the open doorway to the causeway.

Northwest Tower</span></span> <p>The door to this tower has been torn off its hinges and lies on the ground. Originally, a wooden floor was at ground level with a pit beneath it for confining prisoners. The wooden floor is completely rotted away, and the pit has been filled nearly to ground level with garbage and mud.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \" ><p>There must have been a wooden floor in this tower when it was built, to cover the dungeon pit beneath it. Now the floor is gone and the dungeon has been turned into a garbage pit and latrine filled with foul-smelling waste and swamp water to just a few feet below the level of the doorway. The floor above is badly rotted and large portions have collapsed. Through the gaping holes in the second floor, you can see that the third floor is still in good condition. But to reach the stone stairs that circle upward around the outer wall, you must cross 10 feet of indescribable muck.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The pit is home to an @Actor[HZVjst03IQjW2ca1]{otyugh} that consumes much of the castle's garbage.

Allow the attacked character to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 plus the damage caused by the otyugh's tentacle attack. A successful saving throw means the character has a lungful of air when dragged into the muck and can hold his or her breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + his or her Constitution modifier, with a minimum of 30 seconds (5 rounds).

The stalls, originally built for horses, have been enlarged to accommodate the beasts (eight @Actor[iefxzEFHQd02zWmM]{giant lizards}). The normally lethargic creatures grow agitated when strangers enter the stables. If characters linger for more than a minute, two of the lizards start lashing the walls with their tails. The others pick up the ruckus in short order so that within two minutes, all are thrashing at the walls and bellowing. The commotion draws four @Actor[kkqArv4eBp2mWqEo]{lizardfolk} who are the giant lizards' handlers.

Dralmorrer Borngray pays them with articles of looted treasure that he deems too cheap or tacky to include in the hoard being accumulated for Tiamat. The chests contain hundreds of items made from copper and tin and that incorporate small or damaged semiprecious stones.

He despises Pharblex and the bullywugs, and he would prefer to deal solely with the lizardfolk if they could overcome the gloom that has gripped the tribe since Pharblex murdered their shaman. Borngray thought mastering a craft as advanced as metalworking would instill the lizardfolk with a renewed sense of pride. He might be right, but so far, the lizardfolk have shown little aptitude for the craft.

The only things he leaves in these chambers are his clothes and his traveling spellbook—which contains all the spells he has prepared (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>). The spellbook is locked inside a box of silver-inlaid redwood. The lock can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, but if the roll is less than 20, the tampering sets off a magical ward with the same effect as a @Item[gIDSIxJSl8xMjfwJ]{Melf's acid arrow} spell; the acid arrow launches at the character who opened the box and causes [[/r 4d6]] acid damage immediately plus another [[/r 4d6]] acid damage at the end of the character's next turn. The damage is halved if the character makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

This drum can be heard for miles when it is beaten vigorously. The bullywugs send many different signals with the drum: they can recall patrols and foragers to the castle, wake up the camp, indicate mealtimes, announce changes of the guard, and sound a general alarm if the castle ever comes under attack. The drum is heard about six times on a typical day, and everyone who lives at the castle knows the meanings of the different drumbeats.

Inside is Pharblex's share of the bullywugs' pay: silver and electrum jewelry, hand mirrors, shell combs, hair pins and brooches with semiprecious stones, all with a total value of 1,376 gp. Most of the silver is black from tarnish. In a civilized land, every one of these items is something that would be found on a woman's dressing table or nightstand.

Just a few minutes of searching through the junk can turn up one or two bundles of sharp, clean blades for shortswords, daggers, and spears, neatly wrapped in oilskin.</p><p>Unless the lizardfolk are meeting, this chamber usually is empty.

He knows better than to claim them as his own; he will forward these treasures to Tiamat's hoard when the work at Castle Naerytar draws to a close. Until then, he keeps the written material at the castle to study and to divert him from the miserable surroundings. Rezmir knows about the library and approves of using the books this way, as long as they are delivered to the Well of Dragons before Tiamat's arrival.</p><p>Borngray has assembled an impressive library. It contains over one hundred books, quartos, and manuscripts covering the history of the Sword Coast, natural philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, magic, and many theoretical works on alternate reality, time, and dimensional travel.

A few years after the astrologers moved in, they were wiped out by their own leader. Several of the castle's residents were murdered in this topmost room of the northwest tower in particularly hideous fashion. They are still here in the form of three @Actor[MFUgBZYgOFND81pE]{specters} haunting the chamber. They rest quietly, ignoring everything and everyone in the castle, until someone opens the trapdoor and enters.</p><p>The open chamber contains a large table and star charts in scroll racks around the walls. Three bodies are sprawled on the floor, reduced by time to powdery bones and dusty tatters of cloth. As soon as Someone enters the room, they rise as specters and attack. They pursue anywhere in the castle, but they won't leave the castle. They attack other living creatures if they can't get at those who disturbed their rest, but they prefer the intruders over anyone else.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"751\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>Most of the paper star charts crumble into dust when touched, but three are still sturdy enough to be carried away.

Observatory</span></span> <p>The Stargazers converted the top level of the keep into an astrological observatory. The most interesting device they installed was a <i>farseer of Illusk</i>—a telescope-like contraption that is useful for observing and studying heavenly bodies but which can also be used in a manner similar to an @Item[AWUdbXYhfrc7nHK9]{arcane eye} spell. In that mode, the <i>farseer</i> can view a location within fifty miles of it. Tuning and focusing the device this way calls for a considerable amount of skill and practice, and the device's dilapidated condition makes the process more difficult.</p><p>Both Rezmir and Borngray visit this area frequently to study the <i>farseer</i>. The elf has had limited success with it, but Rezmir has mastered its use. Over the past year, she used the <i>farseer</i> to study Voaraghamanthar in the dragon's lair. During those spying sessions, Rezmir discovered the dragon's secret twin.</p><p>To protect this area, Rezmir enlisted the service of four @Actor[83WCqZWtoXhDLiJt]{gargoyles}. They perch day and night on the four corners of the keep's roof, where they can be seen from the ground and where they can see through windows into the observatory. Only Rezmir and Borngray know the gargoyles are alive. If anyone enters the observatory without being accompanied by one of the two cult officers, the gargoyles tear open the observatory's four ceiling hatches and attack. This is the only intrusion they respond to. The gargoyles don't interfere elsewhere without direct orders from Rezmir, and she won't give such an order unless it is the direst of emergencies.</p><p>A character who inspects the contents of the observatory recognizes the <i>farseer of Illusk</i> with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 139, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Arcana</span>) check. After its true nature is ascertained, using it to view a distant location requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 140, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Arcana</span>) check and a successful DC 15 Dexterity (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 141, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Sleight of Hand</span>) check. If the Intelligence check fails, the desired location can't be found. If the Dexterity check fails, the image is too distorted to convey any information. If the Dexterity check result is 5 or less, a key part of the <i>farseer</i> breaks off, rendering the item inoperable.</p><p>When characters find it, the <i>farseer</i> is focused on Waervaerendor's lair. This is a golden opportunity for characters to learn Voaraghamanthar's secret.</p><p>Characters might try to take this item when they leave. The farseer is bulky (approximately 40 pounds) and fragile. Worst of all, it has suffered almost two centuries of neglect. The least amount of rough handling will shatter it. A team of brass-smiths and sages, working patiently, might be able to remove the device from Castle Naerytar intact, but adventurers working in haste have no chance.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"765\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beneath the Castle</span></span> <p>The caverns beneath Castle Naerytar are accessible through area 1S.

If they are still in area 6 or area 7 after 2 rounds, they are attacked by twelve @Actor[KmxKcpnhDFRFKsTv]{giant frogs}. The frogs focus their attacks on small characters they can swallow.</p><p>Frogs move into and out of this area by swimming through a passage that opens below the water level in the southeast corner of the pool. Characters can deduce this fact if they watch the pool for 10 to 15 minutes and make a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 145, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Nature</span>) check. The passage connects to water south of the bullywugs' huts outside the castle. Its total length is 300 feet. At 80 feet from the entrance in this pool, the tunnel branches; the left branch leads to the surface and the right branch extends 50 feet to a dead-end. In the pitch blackness, a swimmer has few cues about which tunnel to follow. A DC 15 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 146, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Investigation</span>) check reveals which tunnel to follow.</p><p>Many bats also roost in this cavern. They can reach the outside through natural chimneys in the roof. The bats don't bother anyone normally, but if a fight breaks out, they become agitated and fill the air.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"777\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">7. Frog Landing</span></span> <p>When they aren't swimming in the underground lake, most of the giant frogs in the cavern sit on this rocky shelf, occasionally snatching bats out of the air with their long tongues. There can be as many as twelve @Actor[KmxKcpnhDFRFKsTv]{giant frogs} here at a particular time, plus up to five @Actor[yCLeuIhBKl9iXPCK]{bullywugs}. The bullywugs don't join the fight if the giant frogs attack characters as described in the area 6 description. Instead, they dive into the water and watch the fight from the edge of the characters' light. If the giant frogs look likely to win, the bullywugs join in. If the giant frogs lose, the bullywugs swim for the underwater exit in the southeast corner of the pool (see area 6).</p><p>Bones of larger animals brought here by the bullywugs and fed to the frogs also litter the ground. Most disturbing of all are three sets of iron shackles anchored to the stone, with human, elf, dwarf, and halfling bones.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"778\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">8. Tadpole Hatchery</span></span> <p>Giant frog tadpoles are raised in this small pool until they are large enough to avoid being eaten by the adult frogs in areas 6 and 7. The tadpoles currently in this area are harmless to characters.</p><p>The passage from area 6 is guarded by two @Actor[yCLeuIhBKl9iXPCK]{bullywugs} to keep adult frogs out. They hide from enemies in area 6 if they can. They'll fight if cornered or if a fight develops in area 6 and they see a chance for victory.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"779\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">9. Crane</span></span> <p>The ledge dividing area 9 from area 10 is a 15-foot drop. A wooden, crank-powered crane has been set up for lowering heavy crates of treasure down to area 10. The crane effectively triples a character's Strength score in terms of how much weight can be lifted. A wooden ladder is lashed to the ledge for climbing up and down.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"780\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">10.

Otherwise, the chamber is empty.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"781\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">11. Frog Shrine</span></span> <p>Pharblex turned this area into a shrine to his distorted notions of religion. Niches in the walls are filled with carvings of frogs ranging from the size of a fist to the size of a pumpkin. Larger carvings sit on the floor. Crude renderings of frogs are scratched into the walls around the niches and colored with chalk.</p><p>Anyone with the Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 147, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Religion</span>) skill recognizes elements in these designs taken from the worship of both Ghaunadaur (god of slimes) and Shar (goddess of shadows), but none of these elements are used in a canonical manner. Pharblex used pieces that he saw in religious icons that arrived in treasure shipments, but he has no understanding of their real meaning. With a successful DC 18 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 148, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Religion</span>) check, a character also sees indications that Ramenos is venerated here. Ramenos is an ancient entity now believed to be in a deep slumber. As far as the character is aware, Ramenos was a god of one of the ancient creator races—if it was ever anything more than a legend. Judging from this chamber, whoever created this place has only the shallowest knowledge about these entities.</p><p>Unless a disturbance develops elsewhere in the caverns, the most likely place to find Pharblex is here, followed by areas 12 and 7 (in that order). Wherever he goes, <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#pharblex%20spattergoo_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'pharblex%20spattergoo_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Pharblex Spattergoo</a> (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a> for statistics) has ten @Actor[yCLeuIhBKl9iXPCK]{bullywug} protecting him.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"782\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">12. Pharblex's Sanctum</span></span> <p>Pharblex comes to this chamber to contemplate the great mysteries of the universe—or so he tells his followers. This is the only place Pharblex goes alone. His bodyguards wait in area 10 or 11 while Pharblex \"communes with the great powers.\" The chamber contains a mud-covered chair and reading table, a box of candles, and a wooden chest.</p><p>The chest is not locked, but it is trapped. If the chest is moved or if the hasp is not opened properly, six clay pots drop from concealed niches in the ceiling. Roll a [[/r d6]] to determine how many pots shatter on the floor. The pots contain fine powder coated with hallucinogenic frog poison. Every creature in the chamber that is neither a frog nor a bullywug must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 11 + the number of pots that broke. A creature that succeeds on the save is unaffected. A creature that fails the saving throw succumbs to the hallucination that all other creatures in the chamber have been transformed into nightmarish, froglike monstrosities. While affected, the creature cannot take reactions and must roll a die at the start of each of its turns. If the die result is odd, the creature must use its action and all of its available movement to move to area 6, enter the pool, and remain underwater. If the die result is even, the hallucinating creature attacks the nearest creature to it, treating it as hostile. The effect lasts for 10 minutes.</p><p>The trap can be spotted by someone who inspects the chest or the ceiling and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 149, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) check. Unbroken clay pots can be saved and used as poison grenades. A pot has a 50 percent chance to break open any time it's thrown. Bullywugs and frogs of all kinds are immune to the poison's effect.</p><p>Pharblex retires to this chamber to study two spellbooks, which he stole from area 2N. Dralmorrer Borngray and Rezmir would be furious if they learned the books were missing. One belonged to a 7th-level wizard and contains spells up to level 4, and the other was written by a 9th-level wizard and contains spells up to level 5 (you pick the spells). Being wizard spells, the magic is beyond Pharblex's ability to learn or cast; his lust for power is great enough to keep him puzzling over the text and hoping for a breakthrough.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"783\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">13. To the Graypeak Mountains</span></span> <p>Mist from area 10 seeps into this room and keeps it filled to a depth of two to three feet. Aside from the mist, the chamber appears empty.</p><p>It is not empty, however. A permanent teleportation circle is carved into the floor, where it is obscured by the mist. Characters with a passive Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 150, {})\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)\" ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\">Perception</span>) score of 10 or higher spot the circle, while dispersing the mist (using a gust of wind spell, for example) reveals the circle to all.</p><p>To travel through the gate, a command word must be spoken aloud (a whisper will do). The command word (\"Draezir\") can be found on a paper on Rezmir's desk in area 3L or from Dralmorrer Borngray if he faces defeat with no escape. When the command word is spoken, everyone and everything inside the gate's circumference is teleported to the corresponding gate in the hunting lodge of Talis the White (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,7\"   >chapter 7</a>). Castle Naerytar and the Graypeak Mountain lodge were constructed by the same reclusive wizard, and this was his means of transit between the two.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"784\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rewards</span></span> <p>Award standard XP for defeated foes.

Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.</p><p><i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"423\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Supplements.</span></span> <p>You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book.

It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"427\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dragon Masks</span></span> <p>The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named Severin Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones.</p><p>Severin's ambition amused Tiamat, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells.</p><p>After Severin (subtly guided by Tiamat) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, Severin became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"428\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Secrets</span></span> <p>The Cult of the Dragon has kept secret its goal to bring Tiamat into the world thus far. Many know of the cult's increased activity along the Sword Coast, especially in the north, but the reasons behind the resurgence are unknown.</p><p>Besides his cultists, Severin has forged an alliance with a splinter faction of the Red Wizards of Thay. This small and secretive group, led by an outcast named Rath Modar, plots to unseat the lich Szass Tam from his position over the Red Wizards. Rath believes that in exchange for his help in releasing Tiamat, she will grant him the power he needs to overthrow Szass Tam.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"429\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cult Organization</span></span> <p>The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.</p><p>Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.</p><p>The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"430\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Overview</span></span> <p>During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, Severin initiates the second part of his plan to release Tiamat: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.</p><p>The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.</p><p>The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward. During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.</p><p>A portal beneath the castle connects to the stronghold of one of the cult's most powerful and most disgruntled members, Talis the White, who can become either a deadly enemy or a crucial collaborator to the characters. With or without Talis's help, the characters must get into a flying citadel that a cloud giant placed at the cult's disposal and prevent it from reaching its destination at the Well of Dragons.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"431\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Rise of Tiamat</span></span> <p><a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT\"   >The Rise of Tiamat</a> continues the tale of <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i>. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i>. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"432\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Advancement.</span></span> <p>This adventure uses the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, completing certain events in the campaign causes the characters to level up. See \"Advancement\" later in this introduction.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"433\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Background</span></span> <p>The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"Dragon Masks,\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.</p><p>However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.</p><p>News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"434\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Secrets</span></span> <p>In the first volume of <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i>, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for Tiamat—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back Tiamat and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing Tiamat to travel to the Material Plane.</p><p>These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile Rath Modar and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. The alliance between wizards and cultists is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"435\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Allied Forces</span></span> <p>This second volume of <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> assumes that the factions of good-aligned adventurers and the people of the Sword Coast are aware of the threat posed by the cult. What's unclear is how to deal with it. Depending on the nature of the characters and their relationships with the factions, different groups might recommend different courses of action to the heroes. It falls to the players to figure out how they want to proceed.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"436\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Overview</span></span> <p>At the start this adventure, representatives of groups and factions from across the Sword Coast meet to discuss their concern about the Cult of the Dragon, and to draw up plans for opposing the cult. The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT,1,chapter%209%3a%20council%20of%20waterdeep,0\"   >chapter 9</a> for details).</p><p>Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.</p><p>Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent Tiamat's return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.</p><p>Events are arranged in this book in a logical sequence for staging <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT\"   >The Rise of Tiamat</a>, and the chapters are numbered for ease of reference. You can even add more chapters of your own devising, or which expand on ideas the players generate.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"437\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Outline</span></span> <p>The events of <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i> lead directly into <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT\"   >The Rise of Tiamat</a>.

She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"442\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cult Strikes Back (Part 1)</span></span> <p>The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes.

Each additional encounter also provides a sense of the wider scope of the setting.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"460\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Monstrous Uprising</span></span> <p>A charismatic @Actor[C35PpGur4hKFrQR7]{half-red dragon veteran} leads a band of 21 @Actor[GquJLN8kiZhlDEFZ]{kobolds} and 7 @Actor[kkqArv4eBp2mWqEo]{lizardfolk}, taking advantage of the unrest along the Sword Coast. The group might besiege a village the characters are staying at, raid and enslave another settlement, or start charging tolls along one of the trade roads of the Sword Coast. This band isn't organized enough to attack all at once and provide a significant challenge to the party. Instead, it shows the increasing anarchy of the region, and the way that Tiamat's rise has emboldened evil creatures that aren't directly serving the Dragon Queen.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"461\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Power of the Cult</span></span> <p>The Cult of the Dragon expands its operation in larger and bolder ways. Its leaders send diplomatic missions to Berdusk, Triel, and other settlements demanding tribute—and offering protection from dragon raids for those who comply. Cultists shake down caravans seeking protection money, and have been burning caravans that belong to the rivals of those who do pay. Less scrupulous merchants are finding it easier to do business with the cult than to fight against them. Any Zhentarim contacts of the adventurers are understandably worried about these developments.</p><p>Elite bands of cultists have been charged with establishing the cult's control from the Gray Peaks to the Sunset Mountains. They seek out allies in the area, with an eye toward choosing friendly territory for a capital city and a seat of power for the cult's Inner Circle. Such bands are led by a @Actor[GXS887FqYIjrSSUf]{dragonsoul} defended by 4 <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dragonclaw_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'dragonclaw_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >dragonclaws</a> and a pack of 3 <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#guard%20drake_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'guard%20drake_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >guard drakes</a>.

Some fiends not wanting to see Tiamat gain worldly power seek to break the alliance between the cult and Thay. This encounter can be used to reveal to the characters the divisions already present among the evil factions.</p><p>The devils who are aligned against Tiamat send a delegation of 5 @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists} and 2 @Actor[cj5UBcEtz8apjTh2]{cult fanatics} (devil worshipers) and a @Actor[j19d8o3TMpDoRGOh]{bone devil} named Lord Volmer to treat with the party. The cultists lead the characters to a large tent, inside which Lord Volmer awaits.</p><p>Using telepathy, Lord Volmer tells the adventurers about the so-called \"Thayan Resurrection\" (the attempt by Thayan exiles to supplant Szass Tam), as well as the fact that Szass Tam intends to destroy Rath Modar and his \"splinter sect\" for their impudence. The bone devil assures the characters that they can earn the Red Wizards' favor by providing him with information leading to Rath Modar's capture.</p><p>Lord Volmer also tells the party that the lords of the Nine Hells are divided when it comes to the matter of Tiamat's release. He tells the party that if Tiamat is prevented from escaping, the party will earn \"powerful friends\" in the Nine Hells. If the characters attack Lord Volmer, he and his allies retaliate. The devil is not worried about dying, since he reforms at full strength in the Nine Hells upon his demise.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"463\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Captive Cultist</span></span> <p>A group of dwarf miners has captured a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Dragon—a Wearer of Purple named Cheela Flegsteel who got a little too greedy while leading a group of cultists that was terrorizing the dwarves. Having killed Cheela's drakes and subordinates, the dwarves bring their prisoner to the adventurers hoping for a reward.</p><p>Cheela has useful information about the cult's activities, which could be used to lead into any chapter of your choice. However, she also knows that a rescue party is not far behind her. The adventurers need to help the dwarves fend off an attack by 4 @Actor[ScwG0GcCanDik1BR]{ogres} and a @Actor[C35PpGur4hKFrQR7]{half-red dragon veteran} named Yggran. The dwarves are hopelessly overmatched and flee rather than fight.

She speaks of her capture by the Cult of the Dragon and her escape from the stronghold at the caldera of the Well of Dragons. (If possible, make Cylanestriel an associate, mentor, or relative of someone in the party.)</p><p>Use this encounter to make the players aware of the dangers presented by a direct assault against the Well of Dragons. The army of the cult is huge and powerful enough to have destroyed a major adventuring group. The Well of Dragons is on alert, and its defensive forces include flights of dragons that prowl the skies above the site. The characters should be made to understand that attacking with a large allied force is their only option for defeating the cult.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"465\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Death at the Council</span></span> <p>During the second or third session of the Council of Waterdeep, rumors spread of an aide from Neverwinter who killed an aide from Mithral Hall and then hanged himself.

The succubus forced her victim to slay the other aide to cover her tracks, then to kill himself.</p><p>If the characters investigate, they can obtain the body to question it using @Item[xeEAiEnkBF8U4Cx5]{speak with dead}, or they might use @Item[bCkVURTEgnGrfezF]{commune} to discover the spy. The succubus has gained another victim by that point—a knight of the Order of the Gauntlet who regularly goes to meet her at her slum dwelling in the Field Ward of Waterdeep. This pattern of murder and suicide continues unless the spy's true identity is discovered.</p></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"466\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running the Adventure</span></span> <p><i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> is a big, sprawling adventure that covers many levels of play and a huge swath of the Forgotten Realms. This book outlines the overall structure of the adventure and presents many chapters and events with which to challenge the characters as they investigate the nefarious plots of the Cult of the Dragon. This is not, however, a script to be read aloud with stage directions that must be followed. <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> does not hold your hand and guide you step-by-step from the story's beginning to its inevitable conclusion. Instead, it presents people, creatures, locations, and situations for the adventurers to explore and interact with in a constantly changing, lively way.</p><p>You, the Dungeon Master, play a vital role. The creators of <i>Tyranny of Dragons</i> have tried to foresee the most likely courses of action that the characters might take in the adventure. However, D&D players are curious and unpredictable, and Faerûn is immense and filled with possibility. In a scenario as open-ended as this one, it is all but guaranteed that at some point during the adventure—and possibly at many points—the players will develop their own ideas about how to handle a situation or how to deal with the cult. And just like that, they'll be off and running in directions that aren't covered by this book. Those kinds of situations put a DM's skill to the test—but they also produce some of the greatest gaming moments and memories.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"467\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Campaign Villains</span></span> <p>The plot to return Tiamat to the mortal realm has brought some of Faerûn's most sinister organizations and most powerful monsters into deadly alliance.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"468\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cult of the Dragon</span></span> <p>The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries. During most of that time, its members have focused on the creation and worship of dracoliches, based on a prophecy translated by the cult's founder, Sammaster. However, those goals changed with the rise of a young cultist named @Actor[070ZNx8GZa0yvWIf]{Severin}.</p><p>Inspired by Tiamat, Severin reexamined the texts translated by Sammaster and discovered a different interpretation, believing that \"naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire...\" Severin's quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, \"the Red Rage of Mintarn.\" The fact that Severin not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed Tiamat in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed Severin a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. Severin took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faerûn now faces.</p><p>Severin kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps Severin prepare the way for Tiamat's return.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"469\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Daily Operations</span></span> <p>The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.</p><p>Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult's official regalia—black clothing that features a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, and festooned with jewelry and draconic imagery reflecting the wearer's favorite type of dragon. Masks are common at cult gatherings.</p><p>Cultists avoid this regalia in public, but a character who knows what to look for can often pick an incognito dragon cultist out of a crowd. Cultists sometimes greet one another with the sign of Tiamat: right hand extended, palm forward, with all five fingers spread in imitation of Tiamat's five heads. Characters trying to pass as cultists might find this sign useful if they don't overdo it.</p><p>Cult members venerate dragons as powerful icons and masters, but their worship is reserved for Tiamat. They look forward to the Dragon Queen's return, believing that she will destroy mortal civilization and usher in a glorious reign of dragons—and of those who helped bring about draconic rule. The complex plot dedicated to bring Tiamat to Faerûn has so far seen the cult recover the five dragon masks and collect an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen. All that now remains is to raise her temple in the Well of Dragons, sacrifice hundreds of victims whose souls will power an ancient ritual, and then use that ritual to open a portal through which Tiamat will emerge from the Nine Hells.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"470\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cult Structure</span></span> <p>The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for \"Wearers of Purple\"—the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales. The cult is ruled by a secretive inner group led by Severin and four other wyrmspeakers—a term of respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong.</p><p>Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates (represented by @Actor[MnVkj0b0sxzZgKMM]{cultists} and @Actor[cj5UBcEtz8apjTh2]{cult fanatics}) have no rank and follow the orders of their superiors. Only initiates that prove their worth are allowed to advance. A Wearer of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dragonclaw_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'dragonclaw_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >dragonclaw</a> (first rank), <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#dragonwing_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'dragonwing_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >dragonwing</a> (second rank), @Actor[eFj0atGMqfcGjrQh]{dragonfang} (third rank), and @Actor[GXS887FqYIjrSSUf]{dragonsoul} (fourth rank). Statistics for those four ranking cultists are found in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#HotDQ,12\"   >appendix D</a>.</p><p>Cult operation groups are assembled to match their assigned tasks. They vary in size, from a few low-ranking cultists operating on their own to hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"471\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wearers of Purple</span></span> <p>The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult's humanoid hierarchy, and their word is law for the cultists in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult's resources.</p><p>Only Severin's inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon as part of their power and authority. Those who do not cultivate and expand this relationship are sometimes demoted. A number of priests of Tiamat have recently been made Wearers of Purple, and have been charged with establishing temples for her open worship in Faerûn. This aspect of the cult's plans is still in the early stages, and the inner circle remains divided on how the Cult of the Dragon should interact with the faithful of Tiamat.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"472\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Inner Circle</span></span> <p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/000-tod-00-01.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Severin\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/000-tod-00-01.png\" alt=\"Severin\"  >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Severin</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div></p><p>These four Wearers of Purple are the keepers of the dragon masks and Severin's most devoted servants in the effort to summon Tiamat. Each of these wyrmspeakers bears one of the dragon masks, which they never part with except under the direst circumstances—and then only at the request of Severin or a draconic ally. The members of the inner circle each have an affinity for a particular color of chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance Severin's plots.</p><p>In addition to Severin, the Red Wyrmspeaker, the members of the inner circle are: Galvan (male human), the Blue Wyrmspeaker; Neronvain (male moon elf), the Green Wyrmspeaker and son of Melandrach, King of the Misty Forest; Rezmir (female half-black dragon), the Black Wyrmspeaker; and Varram (male dwarf), the White Wyrmspeaker.</p><p>If any wyrmspeakers are killed or captured in your campaign—including Rezmir, who the characters might have defeated in <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i>—Severin appoints new followers to his inner council.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"473\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dissent in the Ranks</span></span> <p>Under Severin's leadership, most cultists are devoted to Tiamat—but not all. Some of the old guard dislike the cult's new direction, and long for the established traditions and the rise of the dracoliches. A common thought among the dracolich loyalists is that Severin is being played by the fiendish Tiamat. Notable among these members of the old guard are Naergoth Bladelord, the former commander of the stronghold at the Well of Dragons, and Jorgen Pawl and Iskander, two high-ranking cultists in command of Xonthal's Tower.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"474\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Cult of the Dragon</span></span> <p>Cultists are suitable foes for the adventurers in most situations. They keep a low profile in public, so characters are unlikely to see cultists in full regalia on the streets of Waterdeep or Scornubel. As their plots near fruition, however, the cultists grow bolder and might engage the adventurers openly.</p><p>By the start of <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT\"   >The Rise of Tiamat</a>, the effects of the cult's activities are visible across the Sword Coast. The scorched ruins of farming communities pillaged by cultists for Tiamat's hoard are a common enough occurrence that travelers know something is amiss.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"475\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Red Wizards of Thay</span></span> <p>The Red Wizards hail from Thay, over two thousand miles east of the Sword Coast. A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads. Because of their evil reputation, Red Wizards are arrested or killed on the spot in many lands. For that reason, they often travel in disguise, invisibly, or by magical means.</p><p>For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"476\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rath Modar's Ambition</span></span> <p>One such Red Wizard exile is <a href=\"https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rath%20modar_hotdq\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'bestiary.html', 'HotDQ', 'rath%20modar_hotdq', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >Rath Modar</a>, an illusionist of great skill who long ago made the Sword Coast his home. Having a natural interest in dragons, it wasn't long before Rath Modar came into contact with the Cult of the Dragon and Severin. The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon Tiamat from the Nine Hells. Rath Modar dreamed of an army that could confront and defeat Szass Tam. Out of mutual need, their alliance was born.</p><p>The secret cornerstone of this union is Rath Modar's belief that once Tiamat returns, she will see that the Red Wizards are more useful allies than the devoted but magically weak cultists. Rath Modar hopes that Tiamat will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, Rath Modar plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether Tiamat will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.</p><p>Not all members of the Cult of the Dragon are happy about the Red Wizards' involvement in the cult's plans. Wyrmspeaker Varram foresees trouble in the cult joining forces with Rath Modar's splinter sect. He has warned Severin about the potential danger, to no avail.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"477\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Red Wizards</span></span> <p>Red Wizards can be encountered anywhere on the Sword Coast (use @Actor[LKGT3cqKqcH4reDV]{mage} stats if necessary), whether operating alongside cultists or on their own. They most often work alone, but two or three Red Wizards might join forces for an important assignment. In a public area where their appearance could put them at risk, Red Wizards favor deep hoods and scarves to hide their faces. Their undead @Actor[0tqqxI80TUZoY1k8]{wight} bodyguards are usually nearby—and often <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#invisible_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'invisible_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >invisible</a>. Each Red Wizard specializes in a single school of magic, but all learn spells outside their specialty schools.</p><p>Red Wizards don't share the cultists' fanaticism for Tiamat. For them, bringing the Dragon Queen into the world is just one stage of what they call the Thayan Resurrection—the larger plan to destroy Szass Tam and reclaim Thay. They tolerate the dragon cultists but do not acknowledge them as equals.</p><p>Not every Red Wizard on the Sword Coast is working for Rath Modar or the Cult of the Dragon. Some pursue their own interests, while others are spies for Szass Tam. The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a Red Wizard in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the Red Wizard exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT,7\"   >chapter 16</a>.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"478\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hosts of the Nine Hells</span></span> <p>Tiamat has long threatened Faerûn, often appearing in lands such as Chessenta and Unther to drive mortals to worship her awesome power. Although mortals don't know it, the end of the Sundering and the Era of Upheaval also put an end to such direct meddling by the gods. Without powerful magic and mortal aid, Tiamat cannot travel from her home in Avernus into the world.</p><p>Avernus is a boulder-strewn desolation where fiery comets streak across the sky and devil aristocrats rule from dismal iron fortresses. The River Styx saws a jagged course through Avernus's basalt cliffs, winds its way across ashen plains, and eventually plunges through a yawning pit into the eight levels of the Hells below. All the rivers of Avernus feed into the Styx, each one flowing red with blood beneath a roiling cloud of flies.</p><p>Asmodeus recently reinstated the fallen angel Zariel as the Archduchess of Avernus, reversing an earlier decision that allowed a pit fiend named Bel to take the throne. While in exile from her seat of power, Zariel was at the mercy of Tiamat—a fate that rankles her still. Despite her power as ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, Zariel cannot kill the dragon goddess, and she sees the summoning of Tiamat to the world as a way to be rid of her.</p><p>Zariel has directed her mortal agents to assist those who seek to free Tiamat, and her power has made it easier for the Red Wizards to summon devils and for the Cult of the Dragon to find more adherents. However, just as Zariel wants Tiamat out, other devils would be happy to see the Dragon Queen stay in Avernus. Foremost among them is the deposed pit fiend Bel and the devils still loyal to him.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing Tiamat into the world is a massive undertaking, and Severin has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"479\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Devils</span></span> <p>Devils aren't numerous in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT\"   >The Rise of Tiamat</a> until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \"Devilish Demands\") should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren't working for the cult, don't be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters—not just those of good alignment—in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool's game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers' only option.</p><p>Devils in the adventure should always be one step ahead of the adventurers. Characters who like to charge in and decide on strategy later will find that their diabolical foes have well-executed plans. If the characters plan two steps ahead, the devils are one step beyond that. Nothing mortals do should ever surprise them.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"480\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons</span></span> <p>Severin and his supporters intend to use the ancient draconic artifact known as the @Item[eMDJYk17gUwvRTQ5]{Draakhorn} to rally the chromatic dragons to Tiamat's cause. However, chromatic dragons are notoriously arrogant, territorial, greedy, and suspicious of any creatures begging favors—especially if those creatures might be a threat. Getting dragons to cooperate is a monumental task, even when bringing the Queen of Dragons into the world is the ultimate goal.</p><p>The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous. These relics give their wearers the ability to communicate with dragons, but more importantly, they impart a subtle influence over dragons that cannot be detected. Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"481\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Chromatic Dragons</span></span> <p>The power of the chromatic dragons is a motif running through every aspect of Tyranny of Dragons: <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT\"   >The Rise of Tiamat</a>. As the events of the adventure unfold, more and more dragons respond to the @Item[eMDJYk17gUwvRTQ5]{Draakhorn's} rumbling moan and journey to the Well of Dragons—a migration that inspires alarm and panic in people across Faerûn.</p><p>Characters and players should seldom be allowed to forget that the evil dragons are on the move. Whenever the adventurers are outside, they might see a dragon winging overhead in the distance. The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks. When they travel, burned-out hamlets and demolished caravans line the road.</p><p>Dragons are among the oldest, most intelligent, and most powerful monsters in Faerûn and the Dungeons & Dragons game. Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.</p><p>Characters who can tackle the challenges of this adventure are high enough level to have allies raised from the dead when those allies fall to a draconic foe. If the characters can't do so themselves, their allies in the Order of the Gauntlet or the Harpers should be willing to help out.</p><p>With lifetimes of a thousand years or more to lose, chromatic dragons have no interest in dying in battle against mere humanoids, and they don't sacrifice themselves nobly for any cause—Tiamat included. A dragon caught in a losing battle takes any escape that presents itself, most often simply soaring away. This changes during the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, however, when Tiamat can be seen clawing her way through the portal from the Nine Hells.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"482\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giants</span></span> <p>If the characters claimed Skyreach Castle in <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i>, they might well hear from a frost giant diplomat who shows up to reclaim it as property of the giants who built it. A frost giant named Harshnag lives on Mount Sar north of Waterdeep, and he is sometimes called upon when the Sword Coast faces dire threats. The player characters could fly the citadel to him or—in a more dramatic interlude—he might come to a council meeting and demand the citadel's return on behalf of his kin so that he might rally them against their ancient foes.</p><p>If the player characters did not claim the citadel (or crashed it), this option is not available to them.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"483\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Giants</span></span> <p>Giants are unlikely to appear side by side with dragons anywhere before the final showdown at the Well of Dragons.

The latest incarnation of the group retains its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faerûn, and promoting fairness and equality in quiet, unobtrusive ways. Harpers try to keep out of the public eye, preferring secrecy to fame and using knowledge to win the day over brute force. However, as the Cult of the Dragon grows more brazen and destructive, the Harpers are forced to act more openly in their opposition.</p><p>If the characters played through <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i>, they've already met one of the most influential of the Harpers: Leosin Erlanthar, a male half-elf monk from Berdusk.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"486\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Harpers</span></span> <p>Harper agents operate most effectively alone or in small groups, much like adventurers. When on a mission, they are independent and self-reliant. The ideal Harper is a keen observer, persuasive, and able to go almost anywhere without arousing suspicion.</p><p>NPC Harpers are the kinds of characters who consistently pop up when they're least expected and most useful. If the characters need a safe house in a strange city, are unable to locate an elusive foe, or have been captured by the cult and need inside help to escape, a Harper can offer up a secure hideout, a whispered clue, or a smuggled knife. Bards, mages, and rogues are the most common character types in the Harpers, but characters of every class can be found in the organization.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"487\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Remallia Haventree</span></span> <p><i>Chaotic good female moon elf fighter</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Freedom, respect (\"Our failure would spell an end to all beautiful and honest things.\")</p><p><b>Interaction Traits</b>: Honest, friendly</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: Harper mages and scouts</p><p>The elf noble Remallia—\"Remi\" to her friends—is the Harper's leading delegate to the Council of Waterdeep.

This embodies her attitude about combating the cult as well.</p><p>Remi is convinced that the rumors of Tiamat's return are true, and she is frustrated by the unwillingness of the other Harpers to commit to fighting the Cult of the Dragon. She understands their hesitation, however. The Harpers' have only recently been reformed, and the cause of their near-destruction was the decision to act more openly and aggressively.</p><p>The Harpers measure success in the value and quantity of intelligence gained by a course of action, as well as how that knowledge can be used to leverage an enemy into submission. Remallia wants the party to succeed using such tactics, knowing that this will sway the conservatives in her faction.</p><p>The Harpers are willing to cooperate with unsavory types and leverage evil assets, but not if doing so endangers others unnecessarily. They can respect the deftness and skill needed to make such an arrangement, even if they do not like the arrangement itself. The Harpers are always dissatisfied if the characters kill important cultists rather than capturing them—or at least trying to extract information from them beforehand.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"488\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Order of the Gauntlet</span></span> <p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/002-ooa08-03.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/002-ooa08-03.png\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div></p><p>The Order of the Gauntlet shares the Harpers' dedication to justice and equality, but their methods and attitude are quite different.

Evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day, so that all can see and be emboldened by its destruction.</p><p>Members of the order are driven by religious fervor and by devotion to the principle of justice for all. Whether a member places more emphasis on one or the other of those ideals is an individual choice. Camaraderie and esprit de corps run high within the order, and an individual member will risk anything to save a fellow member or to complete an important mission.</p><p>The Order of the Gauntlet is a young organization, and it is eager and restless for action. It does not take orders from any government or temple, although the opinions of holy figures are greatly esteemed within the order.

Sharing a roadside inn with twenty paladins from the Order of the Gauntlet, or joining their march for a few days when headed in the same direction, should be a memorable experience.</p><p>Clerics, paladins, and monks make up the majority of the Order of the Gauntlet, but any character of a righteous mind is welcome in the order's ranks.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"490\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ontharr Frume</span></span> <p><i>Lawful good male human paladin</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Responsibility, greater good (\"The strong must defend the weak, whatever the cost.\")</p><p><b>Personality Traits</b>: Friendly, hot-tempered</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: Paladins and healing clerics to support the fight against Tiamat's forces</p><p>Boisterous and gregarious to a fault, Ontharr is the leading delegate for the Order of the Gauntlet. He has all the justification he needs to support the party (especially if the characters played through <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i>). However, the rest of the order is not yet convinced. In particular, the order does not tolerate evil, and if the characters are known to have committed acts of a dubious moral nature, Ontharr Frume will be pressured to withhold his support. Members of the order will seek proof that the party is righteous or has divine guidance, for it is only with the blessing of Torm and the other gods that Tiamat can be defeated.</p><p>Just as good deeds must be performed in the light for all to see, evil must be shunned and fought at every turn. Members of the order can be won over by heroic and righteous deeds, but they will turn against characters who cooperate with or tolerate evil. The order can best be swayed by actions that demonstrate heroism and divine providence—uniting the metallic dragons to fight Tiamat's brood, for example. Slaying a wyrmspeaker will also serve the party well, while capturing and delivering such a villain to justice will raise them even higher in the order's sight.</p><p>Ontharr Frume's dedication to heroic justice creates a strong connection between him and the paladin Sir Isteval. However, Ontharr has difficulty reconciling the heroic Isteval of legend with the diplomatic and retiring figure of the Council of Waterdeep. It's incomprehensible to him why Sir Isteval does not take to the field himself in this great conflict.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"491\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Emerald Enclave</span></span> <p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/003-ooa08-05a.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/003-ooa08-05a.png\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div></p><p>The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance. Members of the enclave live in the wilderness or in small communities, and the order has almost no representatives in towns and cities. They are not opposed to civilization, however. Rather, they seek to prevent civilization and wilderness from harming one another. Those who serve the Emerald Enclave are masters of survival and living off the land, of navigating through the wilderness, and of reading the signs that indicate approaching weather, the passage of creatures, and the general weal of the natural world.</p><p>Severin's plan to release Tiamat from the Nine Hells represents a grave threat to the natural order. The Dragon Queen's reign and the ascendancy of chromatic dragons would trigger a continent-wide catastrophe that the Emerald Enclave cannot allow.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"492\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Emerald Enclave</span></span> <p>Members of the Emerald Enclave operate alone or in small groups. Their primary focus is places where the natural world and civilization intersect, because that's where the natural order is most easily upset. Humanoids and monsters alike can become a threat to nature when they are thrown out of balance with their environment or their role in the world.</p><p>Whenever characters are traveling through the wilderness—and especially if they get into trouble in a remote area—they can encounter agents of the Emerald Enclave. If the adventurers need someone to guide them safely across a mountain range or lead them through trackless, monster-infested forest, there is no better choice than a member of the order.</p><p>Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of the Emerald Enclave, but any character with a strong affinity for nature can find a place in the order.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"493\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Delaan Winterhound</span></span> <p><i>Neutral good male half-elf ranger</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Balance, life (\"In all good hearts is a spot of darkness, and in all tragedy is a glimmer of light.\")</p><p><b>Interaction Traits</b>: Quiet</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: Druids, treants, and good- and neutral-aligned lycanthropes</p><p>Delaan has come to the Council of Waterdeep as the lone representative of the Emerald Enclave. Even his regular companion, a winter wolf named Loska, remains on patrol outside the city. Delaan spends much of his time wandering the northern wilderness, and although he visits friends in Nesmé once a year, he otherwise shies away from large settlements. He is clearly uncomfortable in Waterdeep.</p><p>There is no question that Tiamat must be stopped, but the Emerald Enclave wants to see the world restored to order. This sometimes means taking a middle ground in battles between good and evil. Delaan is acutely aware of the destruction accompanying the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon. He knows the cult must be destroyed for upsetting the balance of nature, and he knows that many dragons supporting the cult will die before the end. He would rather not kill unnecessarily, however.</p><p>Delaan is initially reserved in his support of the party. To earn his respect, the characters must recognize that their battle is not just to save civilization but to preserve the natural order. He thus objects to many actions that good or neutral characters might not think twice about—including destroying chromatic dragon eggs and other acts that disrupt the natural cycle.</p><p>Delaan's oldest friend and mentor is a mighty treant named Turlang who resides in the High Forest. With Delaan's support, many treants will join the fight against Tiamat.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"494\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Lords' Alliance</span></span> <p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/004-symbol-alliance.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/004-symbol-alliance.png\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div></p><p>\"The Lords' Alliance\" is not a metaphor. This organization was created and is led by leaders and nobles from across Faerûn. Although many of its members have conflicting goals and long-standing rivalries outside the alliance, they band together in the face of events that are too big for any of them to handle on their own. The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Baldur's Gate, and other cities, families, and trading houses of the Sword Coast might never set aside their differences, but they can pull together when the survival of all depends on it.</p><p>The Lords' Alliance represents the richest interests and the most powerful armies on the Sword Coast. The order controls wealth that can hire mercenaries, ensure the loyalty of wavering princes, and possibly even bribe a few chromatic dragons to switch sides or break from Tiamat's cause. Without the help of the alliance against the Cult of the Dragon, the Dragon Queen's victory might be assured.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"495\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Lords' Alliance</span></span> <p>Even while they are working together, members of the Lords' Alliance are always advancing their own interests. Everyone knows and expects it—it's a fact of dealing with the alliance. That doesn't mean member cities don't cooperate and help each other in times of crisis. But if a crisis rearranges the power structure of the Sword Coast, all the players involved hope that the new order leaves them better off. For anyone to move up, someone else must move down.</p><p>Whenever a military campaign is underway, the Lords' Alliance is likely to be in command. Even if it isn't, alliance representatives will be on hand to observe and advise. If the characters find themselves in legal trouble, a councilor might come to the party's aid with a writ of pardon.</p><p>Fighters and sorcerers are plentiful in the Lords' Alliance, but the order takes on any character who feels at home in civilized lands. Barbarians, rangers, and druids are seldom involved with this faction, which sometimes leads to strained relations with the Emerald Enclave.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"496\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">On the Council</span></span> <p>Because the Lords' Alliance is a confederation, the order sends seven delegates to the Council of Waterdeep, each effectively representing his or her own faction. Their diverse character, motivations, and obligations ensure that they are not in agreement about the current threat facing Faerûn. Moreover, the standing of certain delegates changes from one council to the next.</p><p>Although it is not necessary for all delegates to back the adventurers, without at least some support from the Lords' Alliance, there is almost no way for the party to marshal enough forces to win the day.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"497\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lady Laeral Silverhand</span></span> <p><i>Chaotic good female human wizard</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Creativity, respect (\"We cannot stop what we do not understand.\")</p><p><b>Interaction Traits</b>: Quiet, curious</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: Waterdeep's army and conscript troops</p><p>Lady Laeral is present starting with the second council, at which point she becomes the Open Lord of Waterdeep. She is one of the Seven Sisters—legendary, nigh-immortal figures known to have been blessed by Mystra. (Some even say they are the goddess's daughters.) Her spellcasting ability is impressive but is beginning to wane, and she focuses more on political power than on the arcane these days. The Masked Lords of Waterdeep choose her as the successor to Dagult Neverember between the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, making her the leader of the Lords' Alliance.</p><p>Laeral Silverhand brings centuries of leadership experience and an impressive reputation to the negotiations. A consummate diplomat, she can wield words that wound or soothe with equal ease. As the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she holds great sway with all the delegates except Dagult Neverember, who believes that she engineered his removal from the position of Open Lord.</p><p>Laeral's primary concern is keeping all parties at the negotiating table, and making sure that concrete actions result from each council's discussions. However, she is leery of committing troops to battle. No stranger to the horrors of war, she is keenly aware that the lands represented by the Lords' Alliance need their soldiers for the protection of their own people. Only when convinced that the Cult of the Dragon is likely to succeed in summoning Tiamat does she change her mind. However, she doesn't trust the adventurers with leadership unless their deeds in the field and at the negotiating table have impressed her.</p><p>If the adventurers sway Laeral to their side, she speaks highly of the party in the periods between council sessions. Having the support of the leader of the Lords' Alliance increases the party's stature in the eyes of all other factions, granting additional bonuses.

During the first council, he is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, and leader of the Lords' Alliance. He looks the part of such an impressively titled figure: tall and broad-shouldered, with a thick beard, a wild mane of hair, and a forceful manner. Rarely seen without his hand around a glass of strong spirits, he is a master manipulator and looks and behaves as a king should.</p><p>Strong and decisive, Dagult acts always for the good of his subjects and realm—and in doing so, has consistently built up his own power and wealth. Unfortunately for him, the Masked Lords of Waterdeep have recently chosen to replace him as Open Lord. Laeral Silverhand, his successor, claims her title in the second council meeting.</p><p>Dagult demands order and rewards discipline, but he is pragmatic and driven by results above all else. He knows that nothing comes without effort, and sacrifices must be made when necessary. Tireless in his actions, he never stops until he has achieved his goals. He will use any means at his disposal, as long as those means are legally justifiable—even when such justification must be \"rediscovered\" from long-forgotten or ignored laws.</p><p>In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep. He strongly supports the members of the Lords' Alliance pooling resources, because he worries that neither of his investments can survive the coming catastrophe without assistance. This changes by the second council. Though losing Waterdeep allows him to consolidate his strength, Dagult resents Laeral for taking his position. He avoids letting his feelings cloud his judgment, however, intent on showing that he is a more fitting leader by backing the adventurers and taking a firm leadership role in the council.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"499\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ambassador Connerad Brawnanvil</span></span> <p><i>Lawful good male shield dwarf fighter</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Honor, respect (\"A sturdy axe, a strong hand to hold it, and a straight fight are all we dwarves need to end this little problem.\")</p><p><b>Personality Traits</b>: Hot tempered, suspicious</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: Dwarf soldiers and dwarf-forged armaments and siege weapons</p><p>Son of Banak Brawnanvil and a former king of Mithral Hall, Connerad has made the long journey from Mithral Hall to act as the Lords' Alliance delegate for the dwarves of the North, including Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr.</p><p>Even though Connerad hates dragons, devils, and cultists alike, he is as stubborn as a mule about committing troops anywhere but his homeland.

Like Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism.

His place is at the head of the war council and the front of the battle—but he will take that place only if the party proves worthy of his trust.</p><p>Ravengard is a stern warrior dedicated to discipline and results. Having risen through the ranks of the Flaming Fist by the might of his blade and the sharpness of his wits, he sometimes lacks sophistication and tact, but he possesses an unwavering commitment to the law. More comfortable working with soldiers than adventurers, Ravengard is used to giving orders and having them obeyed without question.</p><p>Though Baldur's Gate is still recovering from the havoc caused by the resurrection within the city of Bhaal, god of murder, the metropolis remains one of Faerûn's most populous, wealthy, and powerful cities. Ravengard recognizes his duty to protect the city above all else, and the Flaming Fist's tired reserves are desperately needed for reconstruction and policing. However, he would love to see the Flaming Fist take a leading role in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon, if only to give the defenders of Baldur's Gate a stature befitting the greatest city in Faerûn.

Fearing that committing soldiers to the effort against the Cult of the Dragon might leave the city weakened, Taern needs to know that the party will protect any troops he lends to the coalition. As such, he seeks to gather as much information as possible about the adventurers and other potential allies.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"503\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sir Isteval</span></span> <p><i>Lawful good male human paladin</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Tradition, honor (\"Against Tiamat, we either stand together or fall alone. Who will stand with Cormyr?\")</p><p><b>Interaction Traits</b>: Honorable, wise, dour</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: The might of Cormyr, including Purple Dragon Knights and War Wizards</p><p>Sir Isteval is a former adventurer and Purple Dragon Knight of Cormyr. Though not an actual member of the Lords' Alliance, he is present at the Council of Waterdeep as the alliance's nominal representative for Daggerford. That small settlement can contribute little to the effort to defeat the Cult of the Dragon, however, and in truth, Isteval has been drafted by Cormyr to gain insight into what looks to be a war brewing on its western border.</p><p>Isteval has too much respect for the other delegates to hide this information from them, and he assures those present that his loyalties—to Daggerford, to Cormyr, to the Lords' Alliance, and to all good folk—are not at cross-purposes. This forthright approach nevertheless causes an uproar among other delegates, and the adventurers must take a hand in insuring that Isteval is not expelled from the council meetings.</p><p>A veteran dragon slayer, Isteval bears a wound in his leg that resists magical healing, and he walks with a cane made from a bone of the green dragon that dealt him the injury. The paladin can be a helpful source of dragon lore, but his advice is always guarded. He sees his infirmity as a reminder from his god Lathander of the dangers of hubris. As befits his deity's ethos, Isteval has chosen to treat his injury as a reason to encourage the heroics of others even as his own legend fades. Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.</p><p>Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.</p><p>Sir Isteval has much in common with Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet. The two are potential allies in all things, which worries some of the other Lords' Alliance members.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"504\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Zhentarim</span></span> <p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/005-symbol-zhentarim.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/HotDQ/005-symbol-zhentarim.png\"   >\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div></p><p>The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.</p><p>Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.</p><p>Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.</p><p>However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see Tiamat ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.</p><p>This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.</p><p>Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT,6\"   >chapter 15</a>.</p><p>In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.</p><p>At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker Varram to steal the <i>White Dragon Mask</i>. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in Varram's portion of the \"<a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT,3\"   >Death to the Wyrmspeakers</a>\" chapter.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"505\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using the Zhentarim</span></span> <p>Black Network agents are useful NPCs that you can introduce at appropriate times during the adventure. Characters who played <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i> have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome Jamna Gleamsilver. If the characters need information or gear they can't obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.</p><p>A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.</p><p>Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"506\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rian Nightshade</span></span> <p><i>Lawful evil female tiefling warlock</i></p><p><b>Ideals</b>: Logic, greed (\"I'm certain we can come to an agreement that all parties will favor. But if not, we have other means of settling the issue.\")</p><p><b>Interaction Traits</b>: Polite, mercantile, ruthless</p><p><b>Pledged Resources</b>: Assassins and mercenaries</p><p>Rian is a member of the Zhentarim and the Black Network's envoy during the third Council of Waterdeep. She is seated at the table as a special adviser to Lord Neverember, and her affiliation with the Zhentarim will not be mentioned. However, neither she nor Lord Neverember try to deny or conceal that affiliation if the characters question why Rian is present.</p><p>The Black Network backs any plans that increase the likelihood of defeating the cult. Any and all alliances are fine, as are any outcomes that add to the council's strategic resources. Rian doesn't have any particular interest in morality, and dark acts have no impact on her attitude toward the party. She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them. She favors discreet execution, interrogation of the corpse with appropriate rituals, and destruction of the body to prevent resurrection.</p><p>The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost. However, such action almost certainly alienates most of the other factions from the adventurers. Unlike the other factions, the Zhentarim's loyalty can be purchased regardless of their respect for the characters, if the party can negotiate terms to be paid by the other factions.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"507\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Metallic Dragons</span></span> <p>The good dragons of Faerûn hear the <i>Draakhorn's</i> call and know what it portends. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the good dragons will take action to oppose the return of Tiamat. However, it remains to be seen whether they do so in concert with the humanoid factions of the Sword Coast, or whether they strike on their own with no thought or concern for the fate of the lesser races.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"508\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Metallic Dragons</span></span> <p>The metallic dragons will strike against the cultists at the Well of Dragons, but they are much more effective if their attacks are coordinated as part of the overall plan of battle. Moreover, if they can be brought into the alliance represented by the Council of Waterdeep, they can help defend humanoid territories from the cult's devastating raids. This is covered in greater detail in <a href=\"https://5e.tools/adventure.html#RoT,5\"   >chapter 14</a>.</p></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"509\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giants</span></span> <p>Though many giants have thrown their lot in with the Cult of the Dragon, most remember the ancient dragon-giant wars with bitterness and hatred. Tales of feuds, bloodletting, and death fuel the giants' hatred of dragons, but the giant races are their own masters. As such, they don't easily cooperate with the small races. Even when good giants see the need and wisdom in joining forces with lesser folk, they often resist the idea out of pride until someone or something can command their respect.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"510\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Giants</span></span> <p>Engaging the giants in an alliance against the Cult of the Dragon can be handled by NPCs (most likely by members of the Harpers or the Emerald Enclave). If the characters completed <i>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</i> in possession of Skyreach Castle, offering to return it to the giants (either behind the scenes or in a side trek chapter of your own creation) is sure to guarantee their support of the factions against the Cult of the Dragon. The presence of giants at the final showdown will be an enormous advantage for the forces fighting against the cult.</p></div></div></div></div></div>","_id":"wc51e18dOvwx4VHb"}
